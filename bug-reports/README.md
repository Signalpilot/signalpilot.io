# Bug Reports & Screenshots

This folder is for bug reports and screenshots to help identify and fix issues faster.

## How to Use

1. **Add screenshots** of bugs you find
2. **Name files descriptively**: `chatbot-too-large-desktop.png`, `mobile-button-overlap.jpg`, etc.
3. **Optional**: Create a markdown file with details: `issue-name.md`

## File Naming Convention

- Use descriptive names: `[component]-[issue]-[platform].png`
- Examples:
  - `chatbot-size-desktop.png`
  - `header-overlap-mobile.jpg`
  - `lazy-loading-scroll-issue.png`

## Example Bug Report (Optional)

Create a `.md` file like this:

```markdown
# Chatbot Size Issue

**Platform**: Desktop
**Browser**: Chrome
**Screenshot**: chatbot-size-desktop.png

## Issue
The chatbot is too large and takes up too much screen space.

## Expected
Smaller, more compact chatbot that doesn't dominate the screen.
```

## Quick Fix Workflow

1. Upload screenshot(s) to this folder
2. Mention the screenshot in your message to Claude
3. Claude will analyze the image and fix the issue
4. Review and test the fix
