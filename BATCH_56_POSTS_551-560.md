> ⏰ THE FIRST HOUR TRADING TRAP
>
> High volatility ≠ high opportunity.
>
> WHY THE FIRST HOUR IS DANGEROUS:
>
> 🎭 FAKEOUTS
> → Judas swings common
> → False moves trap traders
> → Direction unclear
>
> 😰 FOMO PRESSURE
> → "I'm missing the move!"
> → Rush to enter
> → Poor decision-making
>
> 📈 OVERTRADING
> → Every move looks like opportunity
> → Take too many trades
> → Death by a thousand cuts
>
> 🌫️ LACK OF CLARITY
> → No established range yet
> → No clear structure
> → Operating blind
>
> BETTER APPROACH:
> → Let first 30-60 minutes establish range
> → Watch for traps, don't become one
> → Wait for clarity before acting
> → The second move is often the real move
>
> Patience in the first hour saves accounts.
