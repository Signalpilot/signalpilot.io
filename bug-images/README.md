# Bug Images

This folder contains screenshots and images of bugs that are difficult to describe with text alone.

## Usage

- Add screenshots of visual bugs, layout issues, or unexpected behavior
- Name files descriptively (e.g., `chatbot-overlap-issue-2024-11-05.png`)
- Include the date or issue reference in the filename when possible
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, GIF, WebP

## Organization

Feel free to organize images by:
- Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Feature area (e.g., chatbot, homepage, FAQ)
- Bug severity or priority

This helps track issues visually and provides context for bug reports and discussions.
