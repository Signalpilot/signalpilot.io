Liquidity void: Where price moved so fast, no trading occurred.

Liquidity Voids 📊

WHAT IS A LIQUIDITY VOID?
Area where price moved too fast for trading to occur

HOW IT FORMS:
◾ Aggressive move (news, momentum)
◾ Little to no volume in the zone
◾ Gap between candle bodies/wicks

WHY IT MATTERS:
◾ Represents imbalance
◾ "Unfinished business" for price
◾ Often acts as magnet
◾ Price tends to return

HOW TO TRADE:
◾ Mark the void zone
◾ Wait for price to return
◾ Look for reaction inside void
◾ Use as entry or target zone

NOT GUARANTEED:
Some voids never fill. Use with other confluence.

Breaker Blocks 📊

WHAT IS A BREAKER?
A failed order block that flips to the opposite bias

HOW IT FORMS:

📉 BEARISH BREAKER
1. Bullish order block forms
2. Price breaks below it (OB fails)
3. Zone flips to resistance
4. Price returns and rejects DOWN

📈 BULLISH BREAKER
1. Bearish order block forms
2. Price breaks above it (OB fails)
3. Zone flips to support
4. Price returns and bounces UP

WHY IT WORKS:
◾ Trapped traders from failed OB
◾ Stop losses become new orders
◾ Support/resistance flip

Breakers are ORDER BLOCKS that FAILED and FLIPPED.

# POST 219 — 🎓 MITIGATION BLOCKS

**Source:** https://education.signalpilot.io/curriculum/advanced/61-mitigation-blocks.html

## 𝕏 Twitter

**Copy:**
```
Mitigation block: Where institutions come back to fix their losing position.

They bought here. Price fell. They're underwater.
Price returns. They sell to break even.

That's mitigation. That's why the level reacts.
```

Mitigation Blocks 📊

WHAT IS MITIGATION?
Where trapped institutional positions get closed at break-even

THE LOGIC:

1️⃣ INSTITUTIONS BUY
Large position at a level

2️⃣ PRICE DROPS
They're now underwater

3️⃣ PRICE RETURNS
Back to their entry

4️⃣ THEY SELL
Close at break-even
Selling pressure = Price drops again

WHY IT WORKS:
◾ Institutions have "bad" positions too
◾ They wait to exit at better prices
◾ When price returns, they act
◾ Creates predictable reactions

Mitigation = Closing underwater positions.
