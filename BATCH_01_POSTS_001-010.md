### Tweet 1 (Hook):
```
Support doesn't "hold."

It's broken to harvest your stops.

Here's how the liquidity lie destroys retail traders 🧵
```

### Tweet 2:
```
Every stop below support is liquidity.

Smart money needs YOUR stop loss to fill their massive orders.

They don't break support because it "failed." They break it ON PURPOSE.
```

### Tweet 3:
```
The pattern every time:

1. Price approaches "support"
2. Retail places stops just below
3. Smart money drives price down
4. Your stops get hit (they get filled)
5. Price immediately reverses

Sound familiar?
```

### Tweet 4:
```
This isn't conspiracy. It's mechanics.

Institutions can't buy 10,000 BTC at market price without moving the market.

They need counterparty liquidity. Your stop loss IS that liquidity.
```

### Tweet 5:
```
How to stop being exit liquidity:

→ Understand WHERE stops cluster
→ Wait for the sweep BEFORE entering
→ Use the sweep as your entry signal
→ Place stops where liquidity already got taken
```

TD appears when selling exhausts. 🔵

What does that mean?

The Pentarch indicator detects cycle phases:
→ TD (Touchdown) = Selling pressure exhausted
→ Accumulation phase may be starting
→ Not a "buy signal" — a structural observation

What you do with this depends on:
- Higher timeframe context
- Volume confirmation
- Key levels nearby
- Overall market regime

One signal isn't enough. Confluence is everything.

Volume bars show quantity, not quality. 📊

Two candles with identical volume can have completely opposite implications.

Big green candle + high volume = Strong buying? Maybe.

Or maybe it's:
→ Sellers absorbing buyers
→ Exhaustion, not strength
→ Distribution disguised as demand

The raw volume bar doesn't tell you WHO is in control.

Delta analysis does:
- Buy volume vs sell volume
- Aggressive vs passive orders
- Absorption vs exhaustion patterns

What is repainting?

Signals that change AFTER they appear.

That "perfect" entry you see in history?
It didn't exist in real-time.

60-90% of free indicators repaint.

2. Real-time vs historical comparison
3. Check for future data references in code

If signals appear/disappear/move, it repaints.

The Pentarch Cheatsheet 📋

Five signals. Five phases. One complete cycle:

🔵 TD (Touchdown) → Accumulation phase
The selling is exhausted. Smart money may be accumulating.

🟢 IGN (Ignition) → Markup phase
Momentum ignites. The trend begins.

🟡 CAP (Climax) → Climax phase
Buying reaches a peak. Caution ahead.

🟠 WRN (Warning) → Distribution phase
Smart money distributing. Retail still buying.

🔴 BDN (Breakdown) → Decline phase
The cycle completes. Decline confirmed.

Save this. Reference it every time you trade. 📌
