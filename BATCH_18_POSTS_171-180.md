## POST 173 — SUNK COST FALLACY (Blog)

### Twitter/X Copy
```
"I've held this long, I can't sell now."

That's the sunk cost fallacy.

What you've lost doesn't matter.
What happens next does.

The market doesn't care about your entry price. Neither should you.

#SunkCostFallacy #TradingPsychology #TradingMistakes #SignalPilot #TradingEducation
```

### Instagram Caption
```
The Sunk Cost Fallacy 🪤

THE TRAP:
"I've lost so much, I have to hold to break even"

THE REALITY:
◾ The market doesn't know your entry
◾ Past losses don't determine future moves
◾ Holding a loser ties up capital
◾ Hope is not a strategy

THE QUESTION TO ASK:
"If I had no position, would I enter here?"

If NO → Exit. Take the loss.
If YES → Maybe hold. But be honest.

YOUR ENTRY PRICE IS IRRELEVANT
Only current structure matters.

What happened doesn't matter.
What happens next does.

Equity Curve Trading 📈

THE CONCEPT:
Trade your equity curve like you trade price

ABOVE THE AVERAGE:
◾ System performing well
◾ Trade full size
◾ Trust your edge

BELOW THE AVERAGE:
◾ System underperforming
◾ Reduce position size 50%
◾ Or pause trading

WHY IT WORKS:
◾ Prevents catastrophic drawdowns
◾ Trades bigger during good periods
◾ Preserves capital during bad periods
◾ Adapts to changing conditions

Your equity curve is a trend.
Trade WITH it, not against it.

## POST 179 — INSTITUTIONAL ORDER FLOW (Education)

### Twitter/X Copy
```
Institutions don't trade like retail.

They can't enter all at once.
They accumulate slowly.
They need liquidity.

Understanding how they operate changes how you trade.

Institutional Order Flow 🏦

RETAIL VS INSTITUTIONAL:

🙋 RETAIL TRADERS
◾ Can enter/exit instantly
◾ Small size, no impact
◾ React to price

🏦 INSTITUTIONAL TRADERS
◾ Must scale in/out slowly
◾ Large size moves markets
◾ Need liquidity to fill

HOW INSTITUTIONS OPERATE:

📊 ACCUMULATION
Quietly buy over time
Keep price stable while filling

📈 MARKUP
Let price rise after accumulating

📊 DISTRIBUTION
Quietly sell over time
Keep price stable while exiting

📉 MARKDOWN
Let price fall after distributing
