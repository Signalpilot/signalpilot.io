## 📸 Instagram

**Caption:**
> 💸 UNDERSTANDING SPREAD AND SLIPPAGE
>
> The costs you don't see eating your profits.
>
> SPREAD:
> → Difference between bid and ask price
> → You buy at ask, sell at bid
> → This gap is a cost
> → Wider spread = higher cost
>
> EXAMPLE:
> → Bid: $100.00 | Ask: $100.05
> → Spread: $0.05 (0.05%)
> → You're down $0.05 immediately
>
> SLIPPAGE:
> → Difference between expected and actual fill
> → Market moves while order executes
> → Fast markets = more slippage
>
> EXAMPLE:
> → You click buy at $100
> → Fill executes at $100.10
> → Slippage: $0.10
>
> WHEN COSTS MATTER MOST:
> → Scalping (many trades, small targets)
> → Low liquidity assets
> → High volatility periods
> → News events
