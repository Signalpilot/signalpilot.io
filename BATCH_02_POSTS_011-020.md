### Tweet 1 (Hook):
```
Candlesticks show WHERE price traded.

Not HOW. Not WHY.

A big green candle could be buyers winning OR sellers absorbing.

Here's what price action is hiding from you 🧵
```

### Tweet 2:
```
A green candle looks bullish. But was it:

→ Aggressive buyers lifting offers? (Bullish)
→ Passive sellers absorbing all that buying? (Bearish)

The candle looks the same. The meaning is opposite.
```

### Tweet 3:
```
Order flow reveals what candlesticks hide:

• Time & Sales tape reading
• Footprint charts showing volume at price
• Aggressive vs passive order identification
• Iceberg detection

The candle tells you WHERE. Order flow tells you WHO.
```

### Tweet 4 (CTA):

Price action isn't dead dead. But it's incomplete.

The difference in approach is why one group consistently takes from the other.

Here's how smart money actually operates 🧵

### Tweet 2:
```
RETAIL APPROACH:
→ Buys breakouts (late)
→ Sells breakdowns (late)
→ Stops at obvious levels

INSTITUTIONAL APPROACH:
→ Accumulates during fear
→ Distributes during greed
→ Uses retail stops as liquidity
→ Creates price movement
```

### Tweet 4:
```
Same market. Opposite games.

By the time retail sees the breakout, institutions have been accumulating for weeks.

By the time retail panics out, institutions are done distributing.

### Tweet 1 (Hook):
```
60-90% of indicators repaint.

Perfect signals in backtest that never existed in real-time.

You're trading ghosts. 🧵
```

### Tweet 2:
```
What is repainting?

Signals that CHANGE after they appear.

That "perfect" entry you see in history?
It didn't exist when it mattered.
The indicator rewrote the past.
```

### Tweet 3:
```
4 methods to detect repainting:

1. Bar replay test — watch signals form in real-time
2. Real-time vs historical comparison
3. Check for lookahead bias
4. Read the code (if available)

If signals appear, disappear, or move — it repaints.
```

### Tweet 4 (CTA):
```
Never be fooled again.

60-90% of indicators repaint. 🚨

What does that mean?

Repainting = signals that CHANGE after they appear.

That "perfect" indicator showing every top and bottom?
→ Those signals didn't exist when they mattered
→ They appeared AFTER the move happened
→ Your backtest is a fantasy

Where do you put your stop loss?

Just below support, right?

So does everyone else.

That cluster of stops IS the liquidity institutions need. 🧵
```

### Tweet 2:
```
Institutions can't buy 10,000 BTC at market price. There aren't enough sellers.

So they CREATE sellers:
→ Push price below support
→ Trigger your stop (you become a seller)
→ Fill their buy orders with YOUR sell order
→ Price reverses immediately

You're not unlucky.
You're predictable.

Everyone puts stops at the same levels.

Where do you put your stop loss? 🤔

Just below support, right?

So does everyone else.

That's the problem.

Institutions need liquidity to fill large orders. They can't just buy 10,000 BTC at market price.

So they CREATE sellers by:
→ Pushing price below support
→ Triggering your stop loss (you become a seller)
→ Filling their buy orders with YOUR sell order
→ Price reverses immediately after

You're not unlucky.
You're predictable.
