        <div class="container-narrow">
          <p>You found an indicator with a 78% win rate. Backtested over two years. Exposed to 500 trades. The equity curve goes up and to the right like a dream.</p>
          <p>You start trading it live. Within two weeks, you've given back a month of gains.</p>
          <p>What happened?</p>
          <p>The backtest lied. Not because the numbers were fake - but because backtesting itself is fundamentally broken in ways most traders never consider.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Core Problem With Backtesting</h2>
          <p>Backtesting answers the question: "How would this strategy have performed on historical data?"</p>
          <p>But that's not the question you need answered. The real question is: "How will this strategy perform on data it's never seen?"</p>
          <p>These are completely different questions. And the gap between them is where traders lose money.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Problem 1: Curve Fitting</h2>
          <p>Every market has patterns. Some are real and persistent. Most are random noise that happened to look like patterns.</p>
          <p>When you build or optimize a strategy on historical data, you're fitting it to both - the real patterns and the noise. The more you optimize, the more perfectly your strategy captures the noise. It becomes a perfect map of randomness that happened in the past.</p>
          <p>Then the future arrives with different randomness. Your perfectly optimized strategy, tuned to capture patterns that were never real, falls apart.</p>
          <p><strong>How to spot curve fitting:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Strategy has many specific parameters (RSI must be exactly 67, not 65 or 70)</li>
            <li>Performance degrades significantly with small parameter changes</li>
            <li>Strategy works amazingly on one asset but fails on similar assets</li>
            <li>Too many rules and conditions</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The more specific the rules, the more likely they're capturing noise rather than signal.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Problem 2: Look-Ahead Bias</h2>
          <p>This one is subtle and devastating.</p>
          <p>Look-ahead bias occurs when your backtest uses information that wouldn't have been available at the time of the trade. The most common source? Repainting indicators.</p>
          <p>But it goes deeper than that. Consider:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Using end-of-day data for strategies that would execute intraday</li>
            <li>Indicators that use future candles in their calculations</li>
            <li>Strategy rules that were created after seeing the results</li>
            <li>"Avoiding" certain periods because you know what happened</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Even honest backtests can have look-ahead bias baked in. The developer knows that 2020 had a crash, so the strategy has a rule that "happens" to reduce exposure in early 2020. Looks like genius risk management. Actually just hindsight masquerading as foresight.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Problem 3: Survivorship Bias</h2>
          <p>Your backtest includes the assets that exist today. It doesn't include the ones that went bankrupt, got delisted, or collapsed to zero.</p>
          <p>This matters more than you think.</p>
          <p>If you're backtesting a momentum strategy that buys strength, your historical test is only buying the strength that survived. The stocks that showed the same strength patterns but then collapsed aren't in your dataset.</p>
          <p>Your backtest looks better than reality because it's only trading the winners - after the fact.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Problem 4: Market Regime Changes</h2>
          <p>Markets in 2010 aren't markets in 2020. Algorithms that barely existed are now 70% of volume. Retail traders have different tools and behaviors. Monetary policy has shifted dramatically.</p>
          <p>A strategy backtested from 2015-2020 was operating in a historically unusual period of low volatility and consistent central bank support. Then 2022 arrived with inflation, rate hikes, and a different regime entirely.</p>
          <p>The strategy didn't "stop working." It was never tested on the type of market it would actually face.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Problem 5: Execution Reality</h2>
          <p>Backtests assume:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You got the exact price you wanted</li>
            <li>There was no slippage</li>
            <li>Your order didn't move the market</li>
            <li>You could always enter and exit when the signal fired</li>
            <li>Spreads were constant</li>
          </ul>
          <p>None of this is true in live trading.</p>
          <p>That scalping strategy with 55% win rate and 1:1 risk-reward? After realistic slippage and spread costs, it's a loser. The backtest never knew.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>What Actually Works Instead</h2>
          <p>If backtesting is broken, what do you do?</p>
          <p><strong>1. Forward Testing (Paper Trading with Discipline)</strong></p>
          <p>Trade the strategy in real-time with fake money. Record everything. No cheating - if you would have missed the entry live, mark it as missed.</p>
          <p>This is slower than backtesting. It's also more honest. You're seeing exactly how the strategy performs on data it's never seen, with execution you'd actually achieve.</p>
          <p>Minimum viable test: 30-50 trades across different market conditions.</p>
          <p><strong>2. Out-of-Sample Testing</strong></p>
          <p>If you must backtest, do this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Develop the strategy on data from 2018-2020 only</li>
            <li>Never look at 2021-2023 during development</li>
            <li>Once the strategy is finalized, test it on 2021-2023</li>
            <li>No modifications allowed after seeing out-of-sample results</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If it holds up on data it was never fitted to, you have something. If it falls apart, you have a curve-fit system.</p>
          <p><strong>3. Robustness Testing</strong></p>
          <p>Instead of asking "does this work?", ask "under what conditions does this break?"</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Test on multiple assets, not just one</li>
            <li>Test across different volatility regimes</li>
            <li>Change parameters slightly - does performance collapse or degrade gracefully?</li>
            <li>Remove some rules - is the core logic still profitable?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Robust strategies degrade slowly. Curve-fit strategies collapse catastrophically.</p>
          <p><strong>4. Focus on Logic, Not Results</strong></p>
          <p>The best filter for a strategy is asking: "Why should this work?"</p>
          <p>If you can't articulate a logical reason - based on market structure, human psychology, or institutional behavior - the strategy probably doesn't work. Any historical "edge" is likely curve-fitting.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>Stop trusting backtests. Start questioning them.</p>
          <p>When someone shows you amazing historical results, ask:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Was this tested out-of-sample?</li>
            <li>What's the logical basis for this edge?</li>
            <li>How does it perform with different parameters?</li>
            <li>Does it work on multiple assets?</li>
            <li>Is the indicator repainting?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If they can't answer these questions, the backtest is worthless - no matter how good the equity curve looks.</p>
