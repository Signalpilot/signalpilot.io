          <p>Head and shoulders. Double tops. Bull flags. Wedges. Trading books are filled with patterns that supposedly repeat.</p>
          <p>Here's the problem: they don't. At least, not reliably enough to trade.</p>
          <p>A study of over 10,000 pattern formations found that most classic chart patterns perform only slightly better than random - and that's before transaction costs.</p>
          <p>But there is one pattern that genuinely repeats. It appears on every timeframe, in every market, in every era. And unlike chart patterns, there's a fundamental reason why it must repeat.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Cycle Pattern</h2>
          <p>Markets move in cycles: accumulation, markup, distribution, decline.</p>
          <p>This isn't mystical. It's structural. Here's why:</p>
          <p><strong>Accumulation</strong> happens when smart money is buying. But they can't buy all at once - their size would move the market against them. So they buy slowly, absorbing selling pressure over time. Price goes sideways while ownership quietly transfers.</p>
          <p><strong>Markup</strong> happens when accumulation is complete. Smart money stops selling into strength. Supply dries up. Price rises, attracting more buyers.</p>
          <p><strong>Distribution</strong> happens when smart money is selling. Same dynamics as accumulation, but reversed. They sell slowly into strength, unloading to retail traders who are finally convinced the uptrend is real.</p>
          <p><strong>Decline</strong> happens when distribution is complete. No more informed buying to absorb selling pressure. Price falls until it becomes obviously oversold.</p>
          <p>Then accumulation begins again.</p>
          <p>This pattern repeats because it reflects the fundamental mechanics of large players interacting with markets.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Why Chart Patterns Don't Work (But This Does)</h2>
          <p>Classical chart patterns attempt to predict price movement from geometric shapes. But shapes are surface-level observations. They don't explain why price should move.</p>
          <p>A head and shoulders pattern might precede a decline - or the right shoulder might keep extending. There's no underlying mechanism requiring the pattern to complete.</p>
          <p>Cycle patterns are different. They're not about shapes. They're about the underlying reality of money flow.</p>
          <p>When you identify distribution happening, you don't need to predict a specific pattern completion. You just know that informed money is leaving. Eventually, the absence of that buying support will matter.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Seeing the Cycle</h2>
          <p>So how do you identify cycle phases? Not from shapes. From behavior.</p>
          <p><strong>Accumulation looks like:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Price range-bound after a decline</li>
            <li>Lower volume on drops, higher volume on recoveries</li>
            <li>Failed breakdowns that reverse quickly</li>
            <li>Higher lows forming within the range</li>
            <li>Boring. Frustrating. Nothing seems to happen.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Distribution looks like:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Price range-bound after a rally</li>
            <li>Higher volume on drops, lower volume on recoveries</li>
            <li>Failed breakouts that reverse quickly</li>
            <li>Lower highs forming within the range</li>
            <li>Excitement. Headlines. Everyone's bullish.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The emotional signature is part of the pattern. Accumulation feels boring and hopeless at lows. Distribution feels exciting and obvious at tops.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Timeframe Fractals</h2>
          <p>Here's where it gets interesting: cycles nest inside each other.</p>
          <p>A daily chart might show distribution, but the 4-hour chart shows a mini accumulation within that distribution. The weekly chart might show markup, while the daily shows a decline (pullback) within that markup.</p>
          <p>Every timeframe has its own cycle. They interact. Higher timeframe cycles dominate lower timeframe moves.</p>
          <p>Understanding cycle nesting is what separates random entries from strategic positioning. You want alignment - buying during lower-timeframe accumulation within higher-timeframe markup.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Why This Pattern Persists</h2>
          <p>You might wonder: if everyone knows about cycles, why don't they get arbitraged away?</p>
          <p>Because knowing and doing are different things.</p>
          <p>Cycles require patience that most traders don't have. Accumulation can last weeks or months. You can't scalp a cycle.</p>
          <p>Cycles require acting against emotion. Buying during accumulation feels terrifying - price just crashed. Selling during distribution feels insane - price is at highs.</p>
          <p>Cycles are invisible to short-term thinkers. The day trader doesn't care about the weekly cycle. The scalper doesn't see distribution happening over two weeks.</p>
          <p>The pattern persists because it exploits permanent features of human psychology and market structure.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>Forget head and shoulders. Forget triangles and wedges.</p>
          <p>The pattern that actually repeats is the cycle: accumulation, markup, distribution, decline. It repeats because it reflects how large players interact with markets and how human psychology responds to price movement.</p>
          <p>Learn to see cycles, and you learn to see the market. Everything else is just noise.</p>
