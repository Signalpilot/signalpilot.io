          <p>You know you need stop losses. Every trading book says so. So you set one.</p>
          <p>Then price hits it - exactly - and reverses. You were right about direction, wrong about execution. The stop cost you a winning trade.</p>
          <p>This happens so often that traders start to suspect the market is hunting them. It's not (not individually, anyway). The problem is more basic: your stop placement methodology is flawed.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Two Stop Loss Disasters</h2>
          <p>Traders usually fall into one of two traps:</p>
          <p><strong>Trap 1: Arbitrary stops.</strong> "I'll risk 2% of my account." Cool. But where does that put the stop? If it's $1.50 below entry because that's 2%, but support is $2 below entry, you've placed your stop in no-man's-land. It's not based on market structure.</p>
          <p><strong>Trap 2: Obvious stops.</strong> "I'll put it just below support." So will everyone else. That cluster of stops creates liquidity that larger players will hunt. Your "safe" stop is actually a target.</p>
          <p>Both approaches get you stopped out of winning trades. Different reasons, same result.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Market Doesn't Know Your Account Size</h2>
          <p>Here's the fundamental problem with arbitrary stops: the market has no idea how much you're willing to risk.</p>
          <p>If you risk 2% and that puts your stop at $48.50, but the market structure suggests $47 is the real support, price can trade to $48, stop you out, and then rally.</p>
          <p>Stop placement must be based on market structure, not account math.</p>
          <p>The right order of operations:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Identify the structural invalidation point (where is the thesis wrong?)</li>
            <li>Place your stop beyond that point</li>
            <li>Calculate the risk in dollars</li>
            <li>Size your position so that dollar risk equals your percentage risk</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If your structural stop requires risking 3% to trade normal size, you have two choices: smaller position size, or skip the trade. You don't move the stop to fit your account.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Beyond the Obvious Level</h2>
          <p>If everyone sees the same support, everyone's stop is at the same place. The solution isn't avoiding stops. It's placing them where the crowd doesn't.</p>
          <p><strong>Give it room.</strong> Instead of $0.10 below support, go $0.50 below. Trade fewer shares to keep dollar risk the same.</p>
          <p><strong>Use volatility.</strong> ATR measures how much price typically moves. A stop of 1.5-2x ATR gives breathing room for normal fluctuation.</p>
          <p><strong>Think in zones, not lines.</strong> Support isn't a line. It's an area. Your stop should be below the zone, not below the line.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Breakeven Trap</h2>
          <p>Moving stops to breakeven feels responsible. "At least I can't lose."</p>
          <p>But premature breakeven moves guarantee you lose another way: through opportunity cost.</p>
          <p>Price needs room to breathe. Normal pullbacks will hit a breakeven stop and kick you out - right before price goes to target.</p>
          <p>Breakeven stops make sense only when:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The trade has moved significantly in your favor (at least 1R)</li>
            <li>You have a structural reason (new support has formed above entry)</li>
            <li>You're protecting profits, not just entry capital</li>
          </ul>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>Stop losses fail when they're arbitrary (based on account math, not structure) or obvious (where everyone else's stops cluster).</p>
          <p>Better stops are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Based on structural invalidation</li>
            <li>Beyond obvious levels</li>
            <li>Sized by volatility</li>
            <li>Set in advance and respected</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Your stop should answer one question: "Where is my thesis provably wrong?" Put the stop there. Trade a size that makes that loss acceptable.</p>
