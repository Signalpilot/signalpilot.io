          <p>100,000+ indicators in the TradingView public library. Free. Immediate access. Reviews and likes to guide your choice.</p>
          <p>What could go wrong?</p>
          <p>A lot, actually. The free script ecosystem has some excellent tools. It also has traps that will cost you real money.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Quality Spectrum</h2>
          <p>Let's be fair: some free scripts are genuinely excellent. Talented developers contribute tools that rival or exceed paid alternatives.</p>
          <p>But for every quality free indicator, there are dozens that are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Poorly coded (buggy, slow, resource-intensive)</li>
            <li>Conceptually flawed (logic doesn't work)</li>
            <li>Actively deceptive (designed to look good, not work)</li>
            <li>Abandoned (hasn't been updated in years)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The problem is distinguishing which is which before you trade real money.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Repainting Epidemic</h2>
          <p>What you need to know about free scripts specifically: the repainting rate is astronomical.</p>
          <p>Many developers don't even know their indicator repaints. They coded it, saw great historical results, and published. They never tested live.</p>
          <p>Others know exactly what they're doing. Repainting indicators get more downloads because they look more impressive.</p>
          <p>TradingView's review system doesn't filter for repainting. You can have an indicator with 1,000+ likes that completely repaints. The reviews are from people who loaded it, saw perfect historical signals, and hit "like" without ever testing live.</p>
          <p>Before using any free script for real trading:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Watch it live</strong> for at least one session</li>
            <li><strong>Take screenshots</strong> and compare to history later</li>
            <li><strong>Ask the developer directly</strong> - their response tells you a lot</li>
            <li><strong>Assume it repaints</strong> until proven otherwise</li>
          </ol>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Black Box Problem</h2>
          <p>TradingView allows developers to publish "protected" indicators where you can use it but can't see the source code.</p>
          <p>This is a problem:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>You can't verify the logic.</strong> It might be a simple moving average crossover with a fancy name.</li>
            <li><strong>You can't spot problems.</strong> Hidden code might use future data or contain logic errors.</li>
            <li><strong>You can't understand it.</strong> When it stops working, you won't know why.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As a rule: open-source scripts that show their code are more trustworthy than protected scripts. Not because they're always better, but because they're verifiable.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Incentive Problem</h2>
          <p>Why do people publish free scripts?</p>
          <p>Some are genuinely contributing to the community. But many have other incentives:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Building audience.</strong> The script is a lead magnet. Get users interested, then sell premium versions or courses.</li>
            <li><strong>Boosting reputation.</strong> A popular free script gives credibility.</li>
            <li><strong>Gaming the algorithm.</strong> More indicators = more visibility.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>None of these incentives are inherently bad. But they mean the script's primary purpose might not be making you profitable.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>What to Look For</h2>
          <p>Not all free scripts are bad. Here's how to find the good ones:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Open source.</strong> You can see the code. Verify the logic makes sense.</li>
            <li><strong>Active developer.</strong> They respond to questions. They update the script.</li>
            <li><strong>Realistic claims.</strong> No "holy grail" language. Honest about limitations.</li>
            <li><strong>Clear documentation.</strong> What does it measure? When should it NOT be used?</li>
          </ul>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Testing Protocol</h2>
          <p>For any free script you're considering:</p>
          <p><strong>Week 1: Watch only.</strong> Add it to charts. Don't trade it. Just observe.</p>
          <p><strong>Week 2: Live repainting test.</strong> Take screenshots daily. Compare to history. Any changes = reject.</p>
          <p><strong>Week 3: Paper trade.</strong> Act as if you're trading the signals. Track results.</p>
          <p><strong>Week 4: Small size live test.</strong> If it passed weeks 1-3, trade it with minimal position size.</p>
          <p>Only after this month-long process should you consider trusting a free script with real capital.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>The TradingView free library is a gold mine with land mines. Quality tools exist, but they're mixed in with repainting garbage, black boxes, and abandoned projects.</p>
          <p>Before trusting any free script:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Verify it doesn't repaint (trust nothing, test everything)</li>
            <li>Prefer open source over protected code</li>
            <li>Check for active development and support</li>
            <li>Run a month-long testing protocol before real money</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Free isn't free if it costs you your account.</p>
