          <p>You have a trading plan. It's written down somewhere. You believe in it - mostly.</p>
          <p>And yet.</p>
          <p>You took that trade you knew you shouldn't take. You sized up when the plan said don't. You moved your stop. Again. You revenge-traded after a loss. Again.</p>
          <p>It's not that you don't know better. You do. The plan exists precisely because you know better. But something happens between knowing and doing. And it's costing you money.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Gap Between Knowing and Doing</h2>
          <p>Every trader has experienced this: you see yourself about to break a rule, you know you shouldn't, and you do it anyway. You watch your own hand click the button. It's almost like being a passenger in your own body.</p>
          <p>This isn't weakness. It's neuroscience.</p>
          <p>Your trading rules live in your prefrontal cortex - the rational, planning part of your brain. But trading decisions happen under stress, uncertainty, and emotional activation. In those moments, your limbic system - the emotional, reactive part of your brain - takes over.</p>
          <p>The limbic system doesn't know your rules. It knows fear. Greed. The pain of loss. The thrill of potential gain. It evolved to help you survive immediate threats and opportunities, not to follow a written plan about risk-reward ratios.</p>
          <p>When these two systems conflict, the limbic system usually wins. Not because you're undisciplined - because that's how human brains work under pressure.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Rule-Breaking Triggers</h2>
          <p>Most rule-breaking follows predictable patterns. Identify your triggers, and you can prepare for them:</p>
          <p><strong>After a Loss</strong></p>
          <p>You're down. The rules say wait for the next valid setup. But your brain is screaming: "Make it back. Now."</p>
          <p>This is loss aversion - the psychological reality that losses hurt about twice as much as equivalent gains feel good. Your brain isn't trying to follow the plan; it's trying to stop the pain of being down. Revenge trading is self-medication, not strategy.</p>
          <p><strong>After a Win</strong></p>
          <p>You're up. You feel sharp, confident, invincible. The rules say stick to normal position size. But surely you've earned the right to go bigger?</p>
          <p>This is overconfidence. Your brain mistakes one good outcome for evidence of skill, even though the sample size is meaningless. Variance feels like validation. Until the next trade reminds you it wasn't.</p>
          <p><strong>During FOMO</strong></p>
          <p>The move is happening without you. You missed the entry. The rules say let it go. But it keeps running. Every tick higher is money you're "losing."</p>
          <p>Fear of missing out bypasses rational analysis entirely. You enter not because the setup is valid, but because not being in the trade has become unbearable.</p>
          <p><strong>During Boredom</strong></p>
          <p>Nothing is happening. The rules say wait. But you're at the screen, and surely something must be tradable?</p>
          <p>Boredom trades are action for the sake of action. They satisfy the need to "do something" while accomplishing nothing except generating commissions and losses.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Structural Solutions</h2>
          <p>Instead of more discipline, design systems that make rule-breaking harder:</p>
          <p><strong>Pre-commitment Devices</strong></p>
          <p>Set your position size and stop before looking at the chart. Many platforms allow order templates. Use them. When the order is pre-set, you can't "just go a little bigger" in the heat of the moment.</p>
          <p><strong>Physical Barriers</strong></p>
          <p>After entering a trade with a stop and target, close the trading platform. Walk away. The trade doesn't need you watching it. Your watching only creates opportunities to interfere.</p>
          <p><strong>Waiting Periods</strong></p>
          <p>Implement a mandatory 10-minute waiting period between seeing a setup and taking the trade. Set a timer. If you still want the trade after 10 minutes, take it. Many impulsive trades won't survive the waiting period.</p>
          <p><strong>Checklists</strong></p>
          <p>Pilots use checklists. Surgeons use checklists. Traders should too.</p>
          <p>Before every trade: Does this meet entry criteria? Is position size correct? Is stop in place? Is risk-reward acceptable? Is this a valid setup, or am I reacting to something else?</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Identity Shift</h2>
          <p>Here's the deeper work: your rules feel like external constraints. Things you should do. Things that limit you.</p>
          <p>As long as rules feel like restrictions, part of you will always be looking to break them.</p>
          <p>The shift happens when rules become identity. Not "I should wait for valid setups" but "I am a trader who waits for valid setups." Not "I shouldn't revenge trade" but "I am not a trader who revenge trades."</p>
          <p>This sounds like semantics. It's not. Identity-based habits are dramatically more durable than outcome-based habits. When the rule is who you are, breaking it becomes self-contradiction rather than self-indulgence.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>You break your rules because you're human, not because you're weak.</p>
          <p>The solution isn't more willpower. It's better systems - pre-commitment devices, physical barriers, waiting periods, and checklists that make rule-following easier than rule-breaking.</p>
          <p>Know your triggers. Design around them. And when you break a rule anyway, return to the plan immediately instead of compounding the mistake.</p>
