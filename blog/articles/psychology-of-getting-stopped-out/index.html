          <p>Your analysis was perfect. Entry was clean. Stop loss was logical. Then price tapped your stop to the tick, reversed immediately, and hit your target without you.</p>
          <p>It happens so often it feels personal. Like the market knows where your stop is. Like you're being hunted.</p>
          <p>You're not imagining it. But the explanation isn't conspiracy - it's psychology. Yours, and everyone else's.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Why Stops Cluster</h2>
          <p>Here's the uncomfortable truth: your "logical" stop placement isn't unique. It's predictable.</p>
          <p>When you put your stop below the previous swing low, so do thousands of other traders. When you use the obvious support level, everyone sees the same level. When you calculate a 2% account risk and land on a certain price, many others land nearby.</p>
          <p>Stops cluster at obvious levels. And clustered stops create liquidity.</p>
          <p>Large players - institutions, market makers, algorithms - need liquidity to fill large orders. They can't buy 50,000 contracts at market price without moving it against themselves. But they can push price into a cluster of stops, trigger a cascade of sell orders, and fill their buy orders against all those panicked sellers.</p>
          <p>This isn't manipulation in the illegal sense. It's just how markets work when participants of vastly different sizes interact. Your "logical" stop is a target because it's everyone's logical stop.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Emotional Damage</h2>
          <p>Getting stopped out wouldn't be so destructive if it were purely financial. Lose 1%, move on. But that's not what happens.</p>
          <p><strong>First comes the anger.</strong> The market did this on purpose. Your broker is running stops. The system is rigged. This anger feels justified but accomplishes nothing except clouding your next trade.</p>
          <p><strong>Then comes the revenge.</strong> You immediately re-enter, trying to "get back" what the market took. Position size goes up because you're now down and need to recover. Stop goes wider because you don't want to get hunted again. Risk management dissolves exactly when you need it most.</p>
          <p><strong>Then comes the doubt.</strong> Maybe your analysis doesn't work. Maybe you're not cut out for this. You start second-guessing entries, hesitating on valid setups, moving stops to avoid the pain of being stopped out again.</p>
          <p>One stop-out, handled poorly, can spiral into a losing streak that takes weeks to break.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Better Stop Placement Strategies</h2>
          <p>Once you understand why stops get hit, you can adapt:</p>
          <p><strong>Beyond the Obvious</strong></p>
          <p>If everyone puts stops below the swing low, put yours below the level where the swing low stop-out would end. The extra distance costs you some risk-reward. But you're no longer part of the cluster.</p>
          <p><strong>Volatility-Based Stops</strong></p>
          <p>Instead of fixed price levels, base your stop on the market's actual movement. The Average True Range (ATR) measures how much an asset typically moves. A stop of 1.5-2x ATR gives the trade room to breathe within normal volatility.</p>
          <p><strong>Time-Based Stops</strong></p>
          <p>Not every losing trade needs to hit a price stop. If your thesis was "this should break out within 4 hours" and 4 hours pass without a breakout, the thesis failed. Exit.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Emotional Reset Protocol</h2>
          <p>Even with better stop placement, you'll get stopped out. Everyone does. The question is what happens next.</p>
          <p><strong>Wait before the next trade.</strong> Minimum 15 minutes. Ideally, wait for the next setup rather than immediately re-entering. Revenge trades have the highest failure rate of any trade type.</p>
          <p><strong>Check your emotional state.</strong> Are you angry? Frustrated? Determined to "make it back"? These are signals to step away, not trade harder.</p>
          <p><strong>Review without judgment.</strong> Was the stop logical? Was the entry valid? Was the trade worth taking again if the same setup appeared? Sometimes the answer is yes - you made a good trade that happened to lose.</p>
          <p><strong>Normalize the loss.</strong> If you risk 1% per trade and expect a 50% win rate, you'll lose 50% of the time. Being stopped out isn't a failure. It's half the job.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>You will get stopped out. Probably today. Definitely this week.</p>
          <p>The question isn't how to avoid it. It's how to handle it - both technically and emotionally. Better stop placement reduces unnecessary stop-outs. Emotional discipline prevents one stop-out from becoming a losing spiral.</p>
          <p>The market isn't hunting you specifically. It's hunting everyone at the same obvious levels. Stop being obvious. Stop taking it personally. And stop moving your stops.</p>
