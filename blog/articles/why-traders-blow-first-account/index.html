          <p>It's almost a rite of passage. Ask any experienced trader about their first account, and you'll likely hear the same story: early wins, growing confidence, increasing size, then everything gone.</p>
          <p>The sequence is so predictable it might as well be scripted. And yet new traders keep following the same script, convinced it won't happen to them.</p>
          <p>Until it does.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Stage 1: The Early Wins</h2>
          <p>Almost every blown account starts with success.</p>
          <p>This sounds backwards, but it's how it works. The trader deposits money, makes a few trades, and profits. Maybe they caught a trending market. Maybe they got lucky. Doesn't matter. What matters is the conclusion their brain draws:</p>
          <p>"I'm good at this."</p>
          <p>These early wins are the most dangerous moment in a trading career. Not because winning is bad, but because the brain is terrible at distinguishing skill from luck - especially on small sample sizes.</p>
          <p>You won five trades in a row. That's a 3% probability by chance alone (assuming 50/50). Feels like confirmation you've figured something out. Actually proves nothing.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Stage 2: The Confidence Surge</h2>
          <p>Winning creates confidence. Confidence feels good. Confidence also changes behavior.</p>
          <p>You start sizing up. The plan said 1% risk per trade, but why leave money on the table when you're clearly seeing the market well? You go to 2%. Then 3%.</p>
          <p>You start taking more trades. Your edge was one specific setup, but you're hot right now. Surely you can apply the same skills to other setups?</p>
          <p>You stop respecting risk. Stops feel like unnecessary obstacles. You've been right so much, why give the market a chance to stop you out?</p>
          <p>None of this feels reckless. It feels like evolution. You're growing as a trader.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Stage 3: The Death Spiral</h2>
          <p>Then the losses start. Not dramatically - not yet. Just a losing trade. Then another.</p>
          <p>But you're now risking 3-4% per trade. Two losses and you're down 8%. Three losses and you're down 12%. The gains from weeks of trading evaporate in days.</p>
          <p>This is where denial kicks in. Instead of recognizing that you've increased risk and need to scale back, you do the opposite:</p>
          <p>"I need to make it back."</p>
          <p>You size up further. The market owes you. You were right before; you'll be right again.</p>
          <p>Now the math turns brutal. You're down 20%. To get back to breakeven, you need a 25% gain. You risk 5% on the next trade. It loses. Now you're down 25%. You need a 33% gain to recover.</p>
          <p>The hole keeps getting deeper. Each loss makes the required recovery larger. The spiral accelerates.</p>
          <p>Then it's gone.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>How to Avoid It</h2>
          <p>Knowing the stages helps, but knowledge alone doesn't stop the script. You need structural protections:</p>
          <p><strong>Fixed Position Sizing (No Exceptions)</strong></p>
          <p>Decide on your risk per trade before you start trading. 1% is standard. 0.5% is safer. Write it down. Then never, ever change it during a winning streak.</p>
          <p><strong>Drawdown Protocols</strong></p>
          <p>Decide in advance what you'll do at different drawdown levels:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Down 5%: Trade normally, but no new positions until next week</li>
            <li>Down 10%: Reduce position size by half. Mandatory 3-day break</li>
            <li>Down 15%: Stop trading. Review everything.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Early Win Skepticism</strong></p>
          <p>When you start trading, assume your early results are luck. Not because they definitely are, but because you can't know yet. You need 50-100 trades minimum to have any statistical significance.</p>
          <p><strong>Separate the Account Mentally</strong></p>
          <p>Consider your first account "education money." Expect to lose it. This sounds defeatist; it's actually liberating. When you accept that the first account is tuition, you stop trying to get rich from it.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>Blown first accounts follow a predictable script: early wins create overconfidence, overconfidence increases risk, increased risk amplifies losses, losses trigger revenge trading, and the spiral ends in zero.</p>
          <p>Break the script with structural protections: fixed position sizing, drawdown protocols, skepticism about early wins, and treating the first account as education rather than income.</p>
          <p>The traders who survive their first year aren't smarter or luckier. They're the ones who refused to size up when winning felt easy.</p>
