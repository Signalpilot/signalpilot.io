## Project: SignalPilot.io

### Mission
SignalPilot helps traders cut through noise and ship clear signals.  
It offers two TradingView tools built in Pine Script v6:
- **SignalPilot Pro** → invite-only paid strategy with full backtesting and alerts.
- **SignalPilot Lite** → free/demo indicator for visual signals only.  
⚠️ Educational use only — not financial advice.

### Tech Rules
- Use **HTML, CSS, JS only** (no frameworks yet).
- Dark theme UI with **accent color #5b8aff**.
- All pages should share a single **style.css**.
- Each section/page must live in its own folder with an `index.html` inside.
- Keep code semantic, accessible, and mobile-first responsive.
- Favicon: `/favicon.svg`.
