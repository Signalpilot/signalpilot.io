# URGENT: Remove All False Pre-Launch Claims from Documentation

## What Happened

We discovered **false claims** across our marketing materials that could result in:
- **FTC violations** (up to $43,280 per violation)
- **Payment processor bans** (Gumroad, Stripe, etc.)
- **Legal liability** for false advertising
- **Loss of customer trust**

## What Was Removed from signalpilot.io

### ❌ Fake Testimonials (REMOVED)
- 6 fake testimonial cards with fabricated usernames (@crypto_scalper_daily, @es_futures_trader, etc.)
- Made-up trade details ("TD fired at $16.8k BTC...")
- Fake star ratings (5 stars, 4 stars)

### ❌ False User Claims (REMOVED)
- "Used by 500+ traders across 40+ countries"
- "A growing community of traders..."
- "What Traders Are Saying" section
- Schema.org fake reviews (reviewCount: 500, ratingValue: 4.8)

**✅ Replaced with:** "Pre-Launch: Secure Your Founding Member Access"

---

## Action Required: Check docs.signalpilot.io and education.signalpilot.io

**Search for and REMOVE any claims about:**

1. ❌ Customer/trader/user counts ("500+ traders", "40+ countries", etc.)
2. ❌ Testimonials or reviews (unless from verified beta testers with written consent)
3. ❌ Ratings or scores (4.9/5, 47 reviews, etc.)
4. ❌ "Growing community" or similar social proof language
5. ❌ Any trade results or performance claims from "users"

**✅ Safe to keep:**
- Technical explanations of how indicators work
- Educational content about market structure
- Product features and specifications
- Pricing information
- Legal disclaimers ("This is not financial advice")

---

## Why This Matters Legally

### FTC Regulations
The Federal Trade Commission prohibits:
- Fake testimonials (even if marked "example")
- Unverified user statistics
- Misleading social proof claims
- Performance claims without substantiation

### Penalties
- **$43,280 per violation** (each fake review counts separately)
- Criminal charges for systematic fraud
- Permanent ban from payment processors

### Payment Processors
Gumroad, Stripe, and other payment processors **actively scan** for:
- Fake testimonials
- Inflated user counts
- Fabricated reviews

**They WILL ban you** if found. No appeal.

## If You Have REAL Beta Testers

If people actually tested and gave feedback, you CAN use it IF:

1. ✅ You have written consent from them
2. ✅ You use their real names or verified handles
3. ✅ You disclose "Beta Tester Feedback" clearly
4. ✅ You don't edit their words (except grammar)
5. ✅ You include negative feedback if they gave it

**Proper disclosure:**
> **Beta Tester Feedback (Pre-Launch)**
>
> "The Pentarch system helped me identify cycle transitions I was missing before."
> — John Smith (@johntrader), beta tester Oct 2024

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether specific wording is okay, ask yourself:

1. **Is this claim verifiable?** (Can we prove it's true?)
2. **Is this claim current?** (True RIGHT NOW, not aspirational?)
3. **Is this claim material?** (Would a customer rely on it to purchase?)

If answer is NO to any of these → Remove it.

**When in doubt, remove it.** We can add real testimonials after launch.

---

## Summary

**We are pre-launch. We have ZERO customers. We cannot make ANY claims about users, traders, community, reviews, or performance.**

Focus on:
- What the product DOES (technical specs)
- What we TEACH (curriculum content)
- What we BELIEVE (mission/vision)
- What we OFFER (pricing, features)

Everything else waits until launch.
