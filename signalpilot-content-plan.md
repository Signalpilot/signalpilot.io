# ORIGINAL QUOTES MASTER LIST

## For Branded Canva Quote Cards

---

### Mindset & Discipline
```
The best trade you'll ever make
is the one you didn't take.
```
```
The market rewards patience.
It punishes impatience.
There is no third option.
```
```
Your edge isn't the indicator.
Your edge is the discipline 
to wait for it to speak.
```
```
Consistency isn't about winning every trade.
It's about executing the same way every time.
```
```
Hope is not a strategy.
Neither is revenge.
```
```
The goal isn't to be right.
The goal is to be profitable.
They're not the same thing.
```
```
You don't rise to the level of your goals.
You fall to the level of your systems.
```
```
Every trader has a plan
until they're down 3 trades in a row.
```
```
The market will test your conviction.
Make sure it's built on process, not hope.
```
```
Discipline is choosing between 
what you want now 
and what you want most.
```

---

### Risk & Survival
```
Risk management isn't sexy.
Neither is blowing your account.
```
```
The traders who survive long enough to compound
are the ones who sized small enough to stay alive.
```
```
Position sizing is the difference between
a bad week and a blown account.
```
```
Protect the downside.
The upside takes care of itself.
```
```
It's not about how much you make when you're right.
It's about how little you lose when you're wrong.
```
```
One trade should never matter that much.
If it does, you're risking too much.
```
```
The market doesn't know your position size.
But your emotions do.
```

---

### Indicators & Systems
```
Indicators don't predict.
They illuminate.
```
```
The best indicator in the world
can't fix bad risk management.
```
```
More indicators ≠ more clarity.
Usually the opposite.
```
```
Backtests show what happened.
They don't guarantee what will.
```
```
A simple system you trust
beats a complex system you doubt.
```
```
The indicator didn't fail.
The context was wrong.
```
```
Every indicator works sometimes.
The skill is knowing when.
```

---

### Psychology & Reality
```
The market doesn't care about your analysis.
It doesn't care about your conviction.
It doesn't care at all.
```
```
You're not trading the market.
You're trading yourself.
```
```
The hardest part of trading
is doing nothing.
```
```
FOMO costs more than missed trades.
```
```
Your P&L is a reflection of your psychology,
not your strategy.
```
```
The best traders aren't the smartest.
They're the most consistent.
```
```
Confidence without discipline is arrogance.
Discipline without confidence is hesitation.
```
```
The market humbles everyone eventually.
The question is whether you learn from it.
```

### Process & Growth
```
Journal the losses.
That's where the lessons are.
```
```
You don't need to trade every day.
You need to trade well.
```
```
One good setup per day 
beats ten mediocre ones.
```
```
The traders who make it
aren't talented. They're stubborn.
They refused to quit before it clicked.
```
```
Trading isn't hard because the market is complex.
It's hard because you are.
```
```
The goal isn't to eliminate emotions.
It's to stop letting them drive.
```
```
Small improvements compound.
So do small mistakes.
Choose which one you're stacking.
```
```
Learn the rules first.
Then you'll know which ones to break.
