**URL**: `education.signalpilot.io/curriculum/beginner/04-support-and-resistance-basics.html`

**Lesson**: 09-rsi-basics

**Copy**:
RSI measures momentum, not direction.

70+ doesn't mean "sell."

One indicator says buy.

Confluence trading means waiting until multiple tools agree—and sitting out when they don't.

The squeeze before the storm is often more valuable than the storm itself.

**Lesson**: 12-fibonacci-introduction
**URL**: `education.signalpilot.io/curriculum/beginner/12-fibonacci-introduction.html`

**Copy**:
Fibonacci levels aren't mystical.
