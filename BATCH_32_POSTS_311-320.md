**Caption:**
> THE SCALES OF BALANCE
>
> From the Signal Pilot Chronicle:
>
> The merchant studied the markets for decades, watching fortunes rise and fall.
>
> "I've seen volume spikes mean everything and nothing," he said. "How do I know which is which?"
>
> The Scales spoke:
>
> "Volume shows interest—but interest can be fleeting.
>
> Flow shows commitment—where value actually moves.
>
> A spike without flow is noise.
> A spike with flow is conviction.
>
> The balance reveals whether participants are accumulating or distributing, building or exiting.
>
> Don't just measure volume. Weigh it. Feel where the weight shifts."
>
> From this wisdom, Plutus Flow was created—the indicator that weighs flow, not just counts volume.
