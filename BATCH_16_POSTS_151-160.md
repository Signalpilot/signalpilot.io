"Every expert was once a beginner."

THE TRADERS YOU ADMIRE:
◾ Lost money at first
◾ Made every mistake
◾ Felt like quitting
◾ Didn't understand charts
◾ Blew accounts

BUT THEY:
◾ Kept learning

## POST 155 — HARMONIC OSCILLATOR OVERBOUGHT/OVERSOLD (Product)

### Twitter/X Copy
```
Harmonic Oscillator at extremes ≠ Instant reversal.

Overbought can stay overbought.
Oversold can stay oversold.

Extremes show stretched conditions.
Reversals need confirmation.

The Arbiter measures. You confirm.

Harmonic Oscillator Extremes ⚔️

THE MISTAKE:
"Overbought = Sell" / "Oversold = Buy"

THE TRUTH:
◾ Markets can stay overbought for weeks
◾ Markets can stay oversold while dropping more
◾ Extremes ≠ Reversals

WHAT EXTREMES ACTUALLY MEAN:
◾ Momentum is stretched
◾ Conditions are extended
◾ POTENTIAL for reversal higher
◾ Not guaranteed

HOW TO USE:
◾ Extreme + Divergence = Higher probability
◾ Extreme + Key level = Watch closely
◾ Extreme alone = Just awareness

The Arbiter measures. You confirm.
