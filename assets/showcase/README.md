# Showcase Images

This folder contains images for the interactive comparison slider demo on the main site.

## Required Images

### chart-without.jpg
- Screenshot of a trading chart **without** Signal Pilot indicators
- Shows the "before" state - cluttered or confusing chart
- Recommended size: 1400px × 787px (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Format: JPG (optimized for web)

### chart-with.jpg
- Screenshot of the same trading chart **with** Signal Pilot indicators
- Shows the "after" state - clear signals and structure
- Recommended size: 1400px × 787px (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Format: JPG (optimized for web)

## Tips

- Use the same chart/timeframe for both images to show true before/after comparison
- Ensure both images have identical dimensions for smooth slider interaction
- Optimize images for web (use tools like TinyJPG or ImageOptim)
- Keep file sizes under 500KB each for fast loading
