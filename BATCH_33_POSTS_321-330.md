**Format:** Single Image (1080x1080)

**Caption:**
> THE SOVEREIGN'S CROWN
>
> From the Signal Pilot Chronicle:
>
> The young trader approached the throne.
>
> "I study patterns. I analyze levels. Yet I am constantly surprised. Why?"
>
> The Sovereign rose, crown gleaming.
>
> "Because you ignore time.
>
> Markets move in cycles. Accumulation, markup, distribution, markdown. This has been true for centuries.
>
> The patterns you study—they exist WITHIN cycles. A breakout in accumulation differs from a breakout in distribution.
>
> The same pattern, different context, different outcome.
>
> My crown sees what candles cannot: WHERE in the cycle we stand.
>
> Know the phase. Know the context. Only then do patterns speak truth."
>
> From this wisdom, Pentarch was created—The Sovereign's gift of cycle awareness.

> Read the full Chronicle
