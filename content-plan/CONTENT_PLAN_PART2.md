**Slide 2 — The Formula:**

> Position Size =
> Risk Amount ÷ Distance to Stop

**Slide 3 — Example:**
> 📊 EXAMPLE
>
> → Account: $10,000
> → Risk per trade: 1% = $100
> → Entry: $50
> → Stop loss: $48
> → Distance: $2
>
> Position Size = $100 ÷ $2 = 50 shares

**Slide 4 — Why It Works:**
> 🎯 WHY THIS WORKS
>
> ✦ Risk is FIXED regardless of stop distance
> ✦ Wider stop = smaller position
> ✦ Tighter stop = larger position
> ✦ Always lose the same dollar amount

**Slide 5 — Key Principle:**
> ⚠️ KEY PRINCIPLE
>
> → Determine RISK first
> → Then calculate size
> → Never size based on "how much you want"
>
> Let the math decide. Not emotions.

**Slide 6 — Another Example:**
> 📊 ANOTHER EXAMPLE
>
> → Risk: $100
> → Entry: $200
> → Stop: $195
> → Distance: $5
>
> Position Size = $100 ÷ $5 = 20 shares

> → Price breaks previous structure
> → The broken level flips role
> → Old support → new resistance
> → Old resistance → new support

**Slide 3 — Why It Works:**

> → They exit when price returns
> → Their exits fuel the new direction
> → Supply/demand flip at the zone

> BEARISH BREAKER:
>
> 1. Support holds multiple times
> 2. Price breaks below support
> 3. Support becomes resistance
> 4. Price returns and rejects

**Slide 5 — Bullish Breaker Example:**
> BULLISH BREAKER:
>
> 1. Resistance holds multiple times
> 2. Price breaks above resistance
> 3. Resistance becomes support

**Slide 6 — How to Identify:**

>
> → Find clear structure break (BOS)
> → Mark the origin of the breaking move
> → Watch for price to return to zone
> → Look for reaction/rejection

**Slide 7 — Key Context:**
> KEY CONTEXT:
>
> → Works best at significant levels
> → Confluence with other tools helps

### 𝕏 Twitter

**Copy:**
> OTE zone: 62-79% retracement of the impulse.

> Not a guarantee—a probability sweet spot.
>
> Deeper than standard retracements, where better R:R often lives.

### 📸 Instagram

**Format:** Carousel (8 slides)

**Slide 1 — Cover:**
> 🎯 OPTIMAL TRADE ENTRY (OTE)
>
> Where patience often gets rewarded.

**Slide 2 — The Zone:**
> THE ZONE:
>
> → 62% to 79% retracement
> → Deeper than standard 50% pullback
> → Sweet spot for risk:reward
> → Based on Fibonacci principles

**Slide 3 — Why It Matters:**
> WHY IT MATTERS:
>
> → Better entry = tighter stop
> → Tighter stop = larger position (same risk)
> → Or same position = less risk
> → Improves R:R potential

**Slide 4 — Visual Example:**
> [Chart showing impulse move with Fibonacci levels and OTE zone highlighted between 62-79%]

**Slide 5 — How to Use:**
> HOW TO USE:
>
> 1. Identify clear impulse move
> 2. Apply Fibonacci retracement
> 3. Mark 62-79% zone
> 4. Wait for price to enter zone
> 5. Look for confirmation signal

**Slide 6 — The Caveat:**
> THE CAVEAT:
>
> → Price doesn't always reach OTE
> → Strong trends may shallow retrace
> → It's a framework, not a rule
> → Confluence improves probability

**Slide 7 — Key Levels:**
> KEY FIBONACCI LEVELS:
>
> → 50% — Standard pullback
> → 62% — Start of OTE zone
> → 70.5% — Middle of OTE
> → 79% — End of OTE zone
> → Beyond = Potential structure break

> Filled gaps don't disappear—they transform.

**Slide 2 — The Concept:**
> THE CONCEPT:
>
> → FVG forms (inefficiency)
> → Price returns and fills it
> → The filled zone now acts as S/R
> → Gap "inverts" its role

**Slide 3 — Why It Works:**
> WHY IT WORKS:
>
> → Orders were filled in that zone
> → Creates memory in the market
> → Previous inefficiency = current efficiency
> → Zone now has two-sided interest

**Slide 4 — Visual Example Part 1:**
> [Chart showing: Original FVG forming during impulse move]
>
> Step 1: FVG forms

**Slide 5 — Visual Example Part 2:**
> [Chart showing: Price returning to fill the FVG]
>
> Step 2: Gap gets filled

**Slide 6 — Visual Example Part 3:**
> [Chart showing: Price returning again and reacting at inverse zone]
>
> Step 3: Zone acts as S/R (Inverse FVG)

**Slide 7 — How To Use:**
> HOW TO USE:
>
> → Mark FVGs as they form
> → Note when they get filled
> → Watch for price to return again
> → Expect potential reaction at inverse zone

**Slide 8 — CTA:**
> Gaps evolve. Track their lifecycle.

> → Mark Asian session high and low
> → These become targets for later sessions
> → London/NY often sweep one side
> → Real move often follows the sweep

**Slide 3 — Why It Works:**
> WHY IT WORKS:
>
> → Asian range builds liquidity
> → Stops accumulate above and below
> → Active sessions hunt this liquidity
> → Sweep creates entry opportunity

**Slide 4 — Step 1:**
> STEP 1: MARK THE RANGE
>
> → Identify Asian session (7pm-12am EST)
> → Mark the high
> → Mark the low
> → Wait for session close

**Slide 5 — Step 2:**
> STEP 2: WAIT FOR SWEEP
>
> → London or NY opens
> → Watch for break of Asian high or low
> → Quick wick and reversal = sweep
> → Sustained break = possible trend

**Slide 6 — Step 3:**
> STEP 3: LOOK FOR REVERSAL
>
> → After sweep, look for reversal setup
> → Confirmation from price action
> → Target opposite side of range or beyond

> → What was the drawdown?
> → How bumpy was the ride?
>
> KEY METRICS:
>
> 📊 SHARPE RATIO
> → Return per unit of risk
> → Higher = better risk-adjusted
> → Above 1.0 is generally good
>
> 📊 SORTINO RATIO
> → Like Sharpe, but only downside
> → Penalizes bad volatility
> → More relevant for traders
>
> 📊 MAX DRAWDOWN
> → Largest peak-to-trough loss
> → Can you survive it?
> → Emotional and capital test
>
> THE COMPARISON:
> → Strategy A: 20% return, 50% drawdown
> → Strategy B: 15% return, 10% drawdown
> → B is often better despite lower return
>
> Quality of returns matters.

> High volatility ≠ high opportunity.

> WHY THE FIRST HOUR IS DANGEROUS:

> 🎭 FAKEOUTS

> → False moves trap traders
> → Direction unclear
>
> 😰 FOMO PRESSURE
> → "I'm missing the move!"
> → Rush to enter

> 🌫️ LACK OF CLARITY
> → No established range yet

> → Operating blind
>
> BETTER APPROACH:
> → Let first 30-60 minutes establish range
> → Watch for traps, don't become one
> → Wait for clarity before acting
> → The second move is often the real move

> Past losses don't justify future ones.

> THE TRAP:
> → "I've already lost $500, can't exit now"
> → "I've held this for weeks, must keep holding"
> → "I've averaged down twice, one more time"
>
> THE TRUTH:
> → What's lost is already lost
> → Staying doesn't recover it
> → The only question: what now?
>
> THE TEST:
> "If I had no position, would I enter this trade right now?"
>
> → YES: Hold (position still valid)
> → NO: Exit (you're only holding because of past)
>
> WHY IT'S HARD:
> → Admitting loss feels like failure
> → Exiting makes loss "real"
> → Hope is addictive
>
> THE REALITY:
> → Exiting a bad trade is success
> → Holding a bad trade grows the loss
> → Cut losses, preserve capital

## 📸 Instagram

**Caption:**
> 💸 UNDERSTANDING SPREAD AND SLIPPAGE
>
> The costs you don't see eating your profits.
>
> SPREAD:
> → Difference between bid and ask price
> → You buy at ask, sell at bid
> → This gap is a cost
> → Wider spread = higher cost
>
> EXAMPLE:
> → Bid: $100.00 | Ask: $100.05
> → Spread: $0.05 (0.05%)
> → You're down $0.05 immediately
>
> SLIPPAGE:
> → Difference between expected and actual fill
> → Market moves while order executes
> → Fast markets = more slippage
>
> EXAMPLE:
> → You click buy at $100
> → Fill executes at $100.10
> → Slippage: $0.10
>
> WHEN COSTS MATTER MOST:
> → Scalping (many trades, small targets)
> → Low liquidity assets
> → High volatility periods
> → News events
>
> MINIMIZE COSTS:
> → Trade liquid assets
> → Use limit orders when possible
> → Avoid news-heavy periods
> → Factor costs into R:R

> ✅ Can exit quickly
>
> LOW LIQUIDITY:
> ⚠️ Wide spreads

> Losses are business expenses, not failures.

> REFRAME:
> → Restaurant pays for ingredients
> → Trader pays for losses
> → Both are costs of doing business

> WHAT ACCEPTANCE LOOKS LIKE:
>
> ✅ HEALTHY ACCEPTANCE
> → "That loss was within parameters"
> → "I followed my rules"
> → "On to the next one"
> → Move on quickly

> → "The market is rigged"
> → Spiral into revenge

> → But 50% win rate means MANY losses
> → Losses are REQUIRED for edge to work
>
> PRACTICE:
> → Before trading: "I might lose today, and that's okay"
> → After loss: Review, extract lesson, next

> HOW PLUTUS FLOW SHOWS IT:
> → Positive values = buying pressure
> → Negative values = selling pressure
> → Visual, easy to read

> WHAT TO WATCH FOR:
> → Price flat, flow rising = accumulation
> → Price flat, flow falling = distribution
