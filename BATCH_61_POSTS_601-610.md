**Caption:**
> 📊 READING ORDER FLOW SIMPLY
>
> It's not as complicated as it sounds.
>
> THE SIMPLE CONCEPT:
> → Every trade has a buyer and seller
> → But one side is more aggressive
> → Aggressive buyers = buying pressure
> → Aggressive sellers = selling pressure
>
> WHAT PRESSURE MEANS:
>
> 📈 BUYING PRESSURE
> → Buyers hitting ask price
> → Willing to pay market price
> → Price tends to rise
>
> 📉 SELLING PRESSURE
> → Sellers hitting bid price
> → Willing to sell at market
> → Price tends to fall
>
> HOW PLUTUS FLOW SHOWS IT:
> → Positive values = buying pressure
> → Negative values = selling pressure
> → Visual, easy to read
>
> WHAT TO WATCH FOR:
> → Price flat, flow rising = accumulation
> → Price flat, flow falling = distribution
> → Divergence = potential reversal
>
> You don't need to see every order. Just the pressure.
