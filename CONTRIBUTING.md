# Contributing to SignalPilot

1. All pages use **HTML, CSS, vanilla JS**.  
2. Each section lives in its own folder with `index.html`.  
3. Keep nav consistent across all pages.  
4. CSS lives in `style.css` only (no inline styles unless demo).  
5. All commits must have clear messages (e.g., "Add pricing page layout").  
6. Do not remove or rename files unless explicitly required.  
7. Always test changes locally before pushing.
