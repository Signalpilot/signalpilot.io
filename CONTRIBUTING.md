# Contributing to SignalPilot

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is still early stage.  
Please follow these rules to keep everything clean and consistent.

---

## 🛠️ Rules
1. All pages use **HTML, CSS, vanilla JS** only. No frameworks unless approved.
2. Each section lives in its own folder with an `index.html` (e.g., `/product/index.html`).
3. Navigation must remain consistent across all pages.
4. Styles live in `style.css` (avoid inline styles unless demo).
5. Commit messages should be clear and descriptive (e.g., "Add pricing page layout").
6. Never remove or rename existing files unless explicitly instructed.
7. Test changes locally before pushing.
8. Keep the tone professional and friendly — this site is educational only, not financial advice.

## 🚀 Workflow

2. Create a new branch for your feature/fix.
3. Make changes and commit.
4. Push branch and open a Pull Request.
