Risk $100 to make $100? That's a coin flip.

Risk $100 to make $300? Now you only need to win 33% of the time to break even.

Risk-reward isn't about greed. It's about math. 🧵

Risk-reward is the most misunderstood concept in trading 📊

Here's why it matters:

1:1 Risk-Reward
→ Need 50%+ win rate to profit

1:2 Risk-Reward
→ Need 34%+ win rate to profit

1:3 Risk-Reward
→ Need 25%+ win rate to profit

Higher R:R = More room for error.

A stop loss isn't admitting defeat.

It's defining your risk BEFORE the trade.

Fixed. Trailing. Structure-based. ATR-based.

Pick one. Use it. Every single trade. 🧵

4 stop loss types:

1. FIXED — Set percentage/dollar

No stop = unlimited risk = eventually zero.
