## POST 133 — THE ART OF WAITING (Blog)

### Twitter/X Copy
```
The best traders spend most of their time doing nothing.

Waiting for the setup.
Waiting for confluence.
Waiting for confirmation.

Amateurs trade to feel productive.
Professionals wait to be profitable.

The Art of Waiting 🧘

AMATEUR TRADERS:
◾ Trade to feel productive
◾ Bored? Enter a trade.
◾ No setup? Force one.
◾ Constantly in the market

PROFESSIONAL TRADERS:
◾ Wait for their setup
◾ Bored? Stay bored.
◾ No setup? No trade.
◾ Mostly on the sidelines

THE TRUTH:
90% of trading is waiting.
10% is executing.

The money is made in the waiting.
The waiting prepares you for the executing.

## POST 134 — QUOTE CARD (Psychology)

### Twitter/X Copy
```
"Trade what you see, not what you think."

Your opinion doesn't move markets.
Price action does.

The chart tells you what's happening.
Your bias tells you what you want to happen.

Trust the chart.

```

```
The difference between seeing and thinking 👇

"Trade what you see, not what you think."

WHAT YOU THINK:
◾ "It should go up from here"
◾ "This looks like a bottom"
◾ "The news is bullish"
◾ Opinions, predictions, hopes

WHAT YOU SEE:
◾ Price broke structure
◾ Volume confirmed
◾ Level held/failed
◾ Facts on the chart

Your opinion doesn't move markets.
Trade the reality in front of you.

Save this. 🔖
