## The Golden Rules

### The 90/10 Rule
- **90%** of your posts = pure value (education, charts, answers, discussion)
- **10%** = soft mentions (only when naturally relevant)

### The "Would I Say This to a Friend?" Test
Before posting anything, ask: *"If my friend asked me this at a bar, would I immediately pitch them my product?"* No. You'd just help them.

### The Long Game
Community building is a 6-12 month play. You're planting seeds, not harvesting crops. The goal is:
1. People recognize your username
2. People trust your analysis
3. People ask YOU what tools you use (instead of you telling them)

---

## Platform Selection & Priority

### Tier 1: High Priority (Daily Activity)

#### Reddit
**Why:** Authentic discussions, high trust environment, hates self-promotion (which forces you to be genuine)

| Subreddit | Size | Culture | Your Angle |
|-----------|------|---------|------------|
| r/Daytrading | 1.5M+ | Mix of beginners & pros | Answer newbie questions, share cycle analysis |
| r/swingtrading | 150K+ | Patient traders | Multi-timeframe analysis, position management |
| r/technicalanalysis | 100K+ | Chart nerds | Deep TA discussion, indicator debates |
| r/Forex | 400K+ | Forex-focused | Session analysis, institutional flow concepts |
| r/CryptoCurrency | 7M+ | Huge but noisy | Market structure posts, cycle analysis |
| r/BitcoinMarkets | 200K+ | Serious BTC traders | Technical analysis, volume flow |
| r/algotrading | 200K+ | Quant-minded | Non-repainting discussion, backtesting |
| r/TradingView | 50K+ | Your exact users | Help with scripts, indicator questions |

#### Twitter/X
**Why:** Trading community lives here, real-time market discussion, chart sharing culture

**Accounts to engage with:**
- Follow and reply to popular trading accounts
- Quote tweet interesting setups with your analysis
- Join trading spaces (audio rooms)

#### Discord Servers (Join as member, not promoter)
- Trading communities (search "trading discord" on Disboard)
- TradingView unofficial servers
- Crypto-specific servers (for coins you actually trade)

### Tier 2: Medium Priority (3-4x/week)

#### Telegram Groups
**Why:** Real-time chat, coin-specific communities, active during market hours

**Strategy:** Find groups for assets you actually trade. Participate in discussions. Share charts when asked.

#### YouTube Comments
**Why:** High visibility, traders watch educational content

**Strategy:** Leave thoughtful comments on trading education videos. NOT "check out my indicator" but genuine additions to the discussion.

### Tier 3: Lower Priority (1-2x/week)

#### TradingView
- Publish free educational ideas (not promotional)
- Comment on others' ideas with genuine analysis
- Answer questions in the chat

#### StockTwits
- More retail-focused but high volume
- Quick chart shares and market commentary

## Your Persona & Voice

### Who You Are in These Communities

You're a **trader who happens to have built tools** — not a tool seller who happens to trade.

**Your backstory (use naturally when relevant):**
- You got burned by repainting indicators early on
- You spent years studying institutional order flow and Wyckoff
- You built SignalPilot because nothing else showed complete market cycles
- You still trade actively and use your own tools daily

### Voice Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "I've found that..." | "Our product does..." |
| "One thing that helped me..." | "You should buy..." |
| "This is what I look for..." | "SignalPilot is the best..." |
| "In my experience..." | "Unlike other indicators..." |
| Share losses and mistakes | Only share wins |
| Admit when you don't know | Pretend to know everything |
| Use "I" and "we" (community) | Use marketing language |

### Personality Traits to Embody

1. **Patient** — You don't chase, you wait for setups
2. **Humble** — You've blown accounts, you've made mistakes
3. **Educational** — You explain the "why" not just the "what"
4. **Honest** — You don't promise profits, you teach process
5. **Curious** — You ask others about their approaches too

## Ready-to-Paste Responses

### Category 1: Answering Questions (Pure Value)

---

#### When someone asks: "Why do my indicators keep giving false signals?"

**Response A (Short):**
```
Most of the time it's one of three things:

1. The indicator repaints (changes past signals on live data — way more common than people think)
2. You're using it in the wrong market regime (trending indicator in a range, or vice versa)
3. No confirmation layer — single indicators fail, confluence works

What indicator and what market are you using it on? Happy to take a look.
```

**Response B (Detailed):**
```
This drove me crazy for years. Here's what I eventually figured out:

The biggest culprit is repainting. A lot of indicators (especially free ones) use future data in their calculations. Looks perfect in backtests, garbage in real-time. You can test this by watching the indicator on a 1-min chart — if signals appear and then disappear or move, it repaints.

Second issue is regime mismatch. RSI works great in ranges, gets you killed in trends. MACD works in trends, chops you up in consolidation. Most people use the same settings everywhere.

Third is no confirmation. Any single signal has maybe 50-55% accuracy on a good day. You need multiple things agreeing — price structure, volume, momentum.

What are you currently using? I can give more specific thoughts.
```

---

#### When someone asks: "How do I know when a trend is about to reverse?"

**Response A:**
```
The honest answer: you don't know for certain. But there are warning signs I look for:

1. Volume divergence — price making new highs but volume declining
2. Momentum divergence — RSI/MACD making lower highs while price makes higher highs
3. Failed breakouts — price breaks a level but immediately gets rejected back
4. Time exhaustion — trends don't last forever, extended moves get mean-reverting pressure

The key is these are warnings, not guarantees. I use them to tighten stops and reduce size, not to flip positions immediately.
```

**Response B:**
```
I think about it in phases rather than trying to call exact tops/bottoms:

- Accumulation → Markup → Distribution → Decline

Each phase has characteristics. Distribution looks like: price stalling at highs, volume picking up on down moves, lower highs starting to form, early buyers taking profits.

The reversal itself usually isn't one candle — it's a process. By the time you're sure, you've missed most of the move. So I look for the early warnings and manage risk accordingly rather than trying to nail the exact turn.

What market/timeframe are you watching?
```

---

#### When someone asks: "What timeframe should I trade?"

**Response:**
```
It depends on your lifestyle more than your strategy tbh.

- Day trading (1-15 min): Need to be at screens during market hours, high stress, quick decisions
- Swing trading (1H-4H): Check charts 2-3x per day, hold for days/weeks, more forgiving
- Position trading (Daily+): Check once a day, hold for weeks/months, requires patience

Most beginners start with day trading because it feels exciting, but swing trading is often better for learning. Slower pace gives you time to think, less noise, clearer signals.

What's your actual availability like? That usually answers the question.
```

---

#### When someone asks: "Is technical analysis actually useful or is it all BS?"

**Response:**
```
It's useful, but not for the reasons most people think.

TA doesn't predict the future. What it does:
1. Gives you defined risk levels (where to place stops)
2. Shows where other traders are likely positioned (support/resistance)
3. Helps identify regime (trending vs ranging)
4. Provides a framework for decision-making

The "BS" part comes from people treating patterns like magic predictions. A head and shoulders pattern doesn't guarantee a drop — it just tells you where buyers failed and where risk can be defined.

The traders I know who consistently profit use TA as a risk management tool, not a crystal ball.
```

---

#### When someone asks: "Why do I keep getting stopped out right before price moves my way?"

**Response:**
```
This is probably the most common frustration in trading. Usually it's one of these:

1. Stops too tight — you're placing them at obvious levels that everyone else uses too, making them liquidity targets
2. Wrong timeframe stops — using 5min levels for a 4H trade idea
3. Market structure ignorance — your stop is below support, but there's a liquidity pool just below that institutions will sweep

The painful truth: institutions need liquidity to fill orders. Retail stops clustered at obvious levels ARE that liquidity. They're not hunting you specifically, but they're definitely taking the other side.

What helped me: place stops where your thesis is actually wrong, not where it's "safe." If the trade needs that tight a stop to work, the R:R probably isn't there anyway.
```

---

#### When someone asks: "How do I stop revenge trading?"

**Response:**
```
This was my biggest leak for years. What actually helped:

1. Physical circuit breaker — 2 losses in a row = walk away for minimum 2 hours. Non-negotiable rule.

2. Loss normalization — every trade has ~40-50% chance of being a loser even with edge. Losses aren't failures, they're operating costs.

3. Session limits — max 3 trades per day when I started. Forced me to be selective.

4. Written rules — "I will not trade after 2 consecutive losses" written and visible. When you're emotional, you need pre-made decisions.

5. Smaller size — if a loss makes you emotional, your size is too big.

The real fix is understanding that ONE trade doesn't matter. Your edge plays out over 100+ trades. One loss is noise. Revenge trading is trying to make one trade fix everything, which destroys the statistical edge.

Still struggle with it sometimes tbh. It's an ongoing practice.
```

---

#### When someone asks: "What's the difference between smart money and retail?"

**Response:**
```
Main differences:

**Information:** Institutions have order flow data, dark pool access, direct relationships with companies. Retail has public info + delayed data.

**Execution:** Smart money can move markets with their size. They can't just buy — they have to accumulate over time to avoid moving price against themselves.

**Time horizon:** Institutions are often building positions over weeks/months. Retail wants results in days.

**How this matters for us:**

When you see support "hold," often what's happening is institutions are absorbing sell pressure to build a position — not support magically working.

When you see a wick below support that immediately reverses, that's usually a liquidity sweep — stops getting triggered which fills institutional orders.

You can't beat them, but you can learn to read what they're doing and not be the liquidity.
```

### Category 2: Sharing Analysis (Soft Positioning)

---

#### When sharing a chart analysis:

**Template A (No mention):**
```
Watching [ASSET] here.

What I'm seeing:
- [Observation 1 — structure, levels, etc.]
- [Observation 2 — volume, momentum]
- [Observation 3 — potential scenarios]

Waiting for [specific trigger] before considering an entry. Key invalidation is [level].

Not financial advice, just sharing what I'm looking at.
```

**Template B (Subtle mention, only if directly relevant):**
```
Interesting setup on [ASSET].

Seeing accumulation signs on the volume side — buyers absorbing supply without pushing price up aggressively. Classic pre-markup behavior.

The 4H is showing [observation], which usually precedes [outcome] in my experience.

Watching [level] as the trigger. I track this stuff with some cycle tools I built but the concept applies regardless of what you use — look for volume confirming structure, not just price patterns.
```

---

#### When someone asks what tools you use:

**Response (Direct but not pushy):**
```
For charting I use TradingView. For indicators, I actually built my own suite over the past few years because I couldn't find non-repainting tools that showed complete market cycles the way I wanted.

It's called SignalPilot if you want to check it out, but honestly the concepts matter more than the tools. You can apply the same cycle analysis (accumulation → markup → distribution → decline) with any decent volume and momentum indicators.

Happy to explain the framework I use if that's helpful — works whether you use my stuff or not.
```

---

### Category 3: Engaging with Others' Content

---

#### Replying to someone's trade idea (agreeing):

**Template:**
```
Nice read. That [observation they made] is key imo.

One thing I'd add — watch [additional factor]. If that confirms, even higher probability setup.

What's your target and invalidation?
```

---

#### Replying to someone's trade idea (respectfully disagreeing):

**Template:**
```
Interesting take. I'm seeing it a bit differently though.

[Your observation that contradicts their thesis]

Not saying you're wrong — markets humble us all. But that's what's making me hesitant on this one. What's your read on [specific factor]?
```

---

#### Replying to someone who got stopped out:

**Template:**
```
Frustrating but the logic was sound. [Validate something specific about their analysis]

The stop hunt below that level is textbook institutional behavior — your entry wasn't wrong, just caught in the sweep.

One thing that helped me with this: waiting for the sweep and reclaim rather than entering at the first touch of support. Costs you some R:R but avoids getting run.

Next one.
```

---

#### Replying to someone who shared a win:

**Template:**
```
Clean trade. That patience to wait for [specific thing they did well] is what separates consistent traders from gamblers.

Did you scale out or ride the whole move?
```

---

### Category 4: When Directly Asked About SignalPilot

---

#### "What is SignalPilot?"

**Response:**
```
It's a suite of TradingView indicators I built over a few years. 7 tools total — the main one (Pentarch) maps 5-phase market cycles, and the others handle things like institutional volume flow, key levels, and multi-timeframe confluence.

Main thing that makes it different: everything is non-repainting and audited for zero lookahead bias. I got burned too many times by indicators that looked perfect in backtests but failed live.

There's a free education hub at education.signalpilot.io if you want to learn the concepts without buying anything. The methodology works regardless of tools.
```

---

#### "Is it worth the price?"

**Response (Honest):**
```
I'm obviously biased since I built it, so I'll give you the honest breakdown:

It's $99/month or $699/year. Worth it if:
- You trade seriously and want non-repainting tools
- You find value in cycle analysis and institutional volume
- You'll actually use the education resources

Not worth it if:
- You're just starting out (use free resources first)
- You don't have a basic understanding of TA yet
- You're looking for "buy here, sell here" signals without understanding why

There's a 7-day refund policy if you try it and it's not for you. But honestly, if you're not sure, use the free education hub first and see if the methodology clicks.
```

---

#### "How is this different from [competitor]?"

**Response:**
```
I'll be honest — I haven't used every competitor so I can't do a fair comparison on all of them.

What I focused on when building SignalPilot:

1. Non-repainting guarantee (audited, not just claimed)
2. Complete cycle detection (5 phases vs just overbought/oversold)
3. Institutional volume analysis (where smart money is positioning)
4. Works across all markets (not just crypto or forex)

Whether that matters more than what [competitor] offers depends on your trading style. Some people prefer simpler tools. Some want more customization. There's no objectively "best" — just best for how you trade.

What specifically are you trying to solve? Might be able to give a more useful answer.
```

---

### Category 5: Starting Discussions (Thought Leadership)

---

#### Discussion starter: The repainting problem

**Post:**
```
Unpopular opinion: 90% of indicators on TradingView are unusable for real trading.

Not because they're bad ideas, but because they repaint. They use future data in calculations, which means:
- They look perfect in backtests
- They fail in real-time
- You can't trust any signal until the bar closes (and sometimes not even then)

Easy test: put a 1-min chart on and watch the indicator. If signals appear and disappear, or labels move around, it repaints.

This isn't a conspiracy — it's just how most are coded. Developers optimize for "looks good in screenshots" not "works in live trading."

Anyone else burned by this? What's your process for vetting indicators?
```

---

#### Discussion starter: Market cycles

**Post:**
```
One thing that changed how I trade: thinking in cycles instead of patterns.

Markets don't move randomly, but they don't move in perfect patterns either. What they do:

Accumulation → Markup → Distribution → Decline → Repeat

Each phase has tells:
- Accumulation: Volume absorption, higher lows forming, smart money buying fear
- Markup: Breakout, trend confirmation, retail FOMO kicks in
- Distribution: Stalling highs, volume divergence, smart money selling to late buyers
- Decline: Structure break, panic selling, retail capitulation

Instead of asking "is this a head and shoulders?" I ask "what phase is this market in?"

Completely different lens. Changed my win rate significantly.

How do others think about market structure?
```

---

#### Discussion starter: Stop hunting reality

**Post:**
```
PSA for newer traders: Your stops aren't getting "hunted" by some conspiracy.

But they ARE getting taken by institutions who need liquidity.

Here's the reality: A fund that wants to buy $50M worth of BTC can't just market buy. They'd move the price 5%+ against themselves. So they need sellers.

Where are the sellers? Right below support levels — that's where retail puts stops.

So price sweeps below support, triggers all those sell stops, institutions fill their buy orders against those market sells, and price reverses.

It's not personal. It's just how markets work at scale.

The fix isn't "don't use stops." The fix is:
1. Place stops where your thesis is actually wrong, not at obvious levels
2. Wait for sweeps and reclaims before entering
3. Accept that some stop outs are just the cost of having defined risk

Anyone else have techniques for avoiding the obvious liquidity grabs?
```

---

#### Discussion starter: Trading psychology

**Post:**
```
Honest question: How long did it take you to stop overtrading?

I tracked my stats for 6 months and found that 80% of my losses came from trades I took "because I was bored" or "to make back the last loss."

My actual high-conviction setups won ~58% of the time. My "I should probably trade something" setups won ~35%.

The math was brutal: I was literally paying money to be entertained.

What helped:
- Max 3 trades per day hard limit
- Only trading first 2 hours and last hour
- Writing down why BEFORE entering, not after

Still working on it though. What's worked for you?
```

---

### Category 6: Crypto-Specific Content

---

#### When asked about a specific coin setup:

**Template:**
```
Looking at [COIN], here's what I see:

**Structure:** [Higher timeframe trend, key levels]
**Volume:** [What the volume is telling you]
**Catalyst:** [Any upcoming events, narrative]

My bias: [Long/Short/Neutral] above/below [level]

Risk: [What could invalidate this]

Not a recommendation — just how I'm reading it. What's your take?
```

---

#### Responding to "wen moon" type posts:

**Response (Educational redirect):**
```
Lol I feel you, but "wen" questions usually mean:
1. You're sized too big (the position is causing anxiety)
2. You don't have a thesis beyond "number go up"
3. You need to zoom out

What's your actual thesis on this one? Like, what has to happen for it to work?
```

---

### Category 7: Building Relationships

---

#### DM template after good discussion (Don't send immediately — wait a few exchanges):

```
Hey — enjoyed that discussion on [topic] earlier.

I don't usually DM people but your approach to [specific thing they mentioned] resonated with how I think about markets.

No pitch, just wanted to connect. Always good to know other serious traders.

What markets do you mainly focus on?
```

---

#### When someone thanks you for help:

```
Happy it helped. Trading's hard enough without having to figure everything out alone.

Feel free to hit me up if you have other questions. Always down to talk markets.
```

---

## What NOT to Do

### The Blacklist

1. **Never post invite links to your Discord unprompted**
   - Instant credibility killer
   - Most communities ban for this

2. **Never DM people with pitches**
   - Especially right after they post something
   - It's obvious and creepy

3. **Never use multiple accounts**
   - You will get caught
   - Destroys all trust

4. **Never fake testimonials or results**
   - Screenshots of P&L without context
   - "I made 500% using this" posts

5. **Never badmouth competitors**
   - Makes you look insecure
   - Community respects those who stay in their lane

6. **Never respond defensively to criticism**
   - If someone says your tools suck, either ignore or respond with curiosity
   - Getting defensive = looking guilty

7. **Never spam the same message across communities**
   - People notice
   - Instant ban in most places

8. **Never promise profits**
   - It's illegal in most jurisdictions
   - It's also dishonest

### Red Flags That You're Being Too Salesy

- You mention SignalPilot more than once per thread
- You're steering conversations toward your product
- You feel the need to "close" someone
- Your post history is only about SignalPilot
- You're copy-pasting responses
- You're talking more than listening

### Recovery If You Mess Up

If you get called out for being promotional:

```
Fair point. Didn't mean to come across as pitchy — genuinely just trying to share what I've found useful.

Happy to stick to the concepts without the product mentions. The methodology matters more than the tools anyway.

[Then actually do that for a while before mentioning anything again]
```

## Specific Community Tactics

### Reddit-Specific

**Rules to follow:**
- Read each sub's rules before posting
- Build karma in sub before sharing any links
- Flair appropriately
- Don't post same content to multiple subs
- Disclose affiliation if directly promoting

**Power moves:**
- Create genuinely useful text posts (not links)
- Answer questions in "Daily Discussion" threads
- Be consistently present, not drive-by

**Example Reddit profile bio:**
```
Trader. Built some TradingView indicators (SignalPilot). Mostly here to talk markets and learn. DMs open for trading discussion.
```

### Twitter-Specific

**Bio that works:**
```
Building SignalPilot — TradingView indicators that don't repaint. Trading since [year]. Sharing setups, lessons, and occasional losses.
```

**Content mix:**
- 40% market commentary
- 30% educational threads
- 20% engagement with others
- 10% SignalPilot-related (subtle)

**Good tweet formats:**
- "Here's what I'm watching today..." (chart + brief thesis)
- "Lesson from today's trade..." (win or loss with learning)
- Thread on specific concept
- Quote tweet interesting setup with your take

### Telegram-Specific

**Group finding:**
- Search coin names + "telegram"
- Join groups for coins you actually hold/trade
- Lurk before posting

**Rules:**
- Most groups hate promotion — be extremely subtle
- Share analysis, not products
- Build reputation through accuracy, not volume

## Final Thoughts

The best community builders I've seen follow one principle:

**Be so helpful that people feel guilty NOT checking out what you've built.**

If your username becomes synonymous with "this person actually helps," the sales take care of themselves.

The traders who spam their Discord link in every thread? Nobody remembers their actual analysis.

The traders who spend months genuinely helping, sharing their losses, explaining concepts? When they finally mention "oh yeah I built some tools," people are genuinely curious.

That's the goal. Not "convert this thread into a sale." But "become the person whose tools people want to use because they trust your thinking."

Play the long game. The internet never forgets who was helpful.
