### Tweet 1 (Hook):
```
Revenge trading isn't a discipline problem.

It's a neuroscience problem.

Loss aversion triggers the amygdala. You can't willpower your way out.

You need systems. 🧵
```

### Tweet 2:
```
What happens after a loss:

1. Amygdala activates (threat response)
2. Cortisol floods your system
3. Prefrontal cortex goes offline
4. You NEED to make it back
5. You take a bad trade
6. You lose more
```

### Tweet 3:
```
Your brain is literally hijacked.

You can't "be more disciplined."

You need SYSTEMS:
→ Daily loss limits (auto-stop after X losses)
→ Mandatory break after losses
→ Pre-committed position sizes
→ Circuit breakers you can't override
```

Revenge trading isn't a discipline problem. 🧠

It's a neuroscience problem.

What happens after a loss:

1. Amygdala activates (threat response)
2. Cortisol floods your system (stress hormone)
3. Prefrontal cortex goes offline (rational thinking impaired)
4. You NEED to make it back (loss aversion)
5. You take a bad trade
6. You lose more
7. Repeat

You can't willpower your way out of this.

Your brain is literally hijacked.

The solution isn't "be more disciplined."

The solution is SYSTEMS:
→ Daily loss limits (auto-stop after X losses)
→ Mandatory break after losses
→ Pre-committed position sizes
→ Circuit breakers you can't override

Confirmation bias makes traders ignore warning signs and double down on bad ideas.

Confirmation bias in action:

You're long BTC.
You see: "Golden cross forming!"
You ignore: Downtrend, weak volume, resistance above.

The most dangerous thing in trading? Your own mind. 🧠

Confirmation bias is when you:
→ Only see signals that support your position
→ Ignore red flags screaming at you
→ Convince yourself "this time is different"

The chart doesn't lie. But your brain does.

The fix:
Before every trade, actively look for reasons you're WRONG.
If you can't find any — you're not looking hard enough.

POSITION SIZING.

Here's the math:

📉 10 losses at 10% risk = 35% account remaining

Volume bars lie. Cumulative flow doesn't.

Plutus Flow (The Scales) shows where money may actually be moving—not just how much traded.

Green volume on a red candle? That's absorption.

Regular volume tells you HOW MUCH traded.

Plutus Flow tells you WHERE it's going. ⚖️

The Scales (Plutus Flow) uses statistical OBV to show:
→ Accumulation hiding under red candles
→ Distribution hiding under green candles
→ Divergences before price confirms

Standard volume: "Lots of trading happened"
Plutus Flow: "Money may be flowing OUT"

Absorption: When large players quietly accumulate while price falls.

Price falling on high volume doesn't always mean selling.

Sometimes buyers are "absorbing" the panic sellers.

→ High volume on down move
→ Price stabilizes or reverses
→ Wicks rejecting lows
