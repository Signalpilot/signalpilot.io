> The young trader watched price dance between levels, frustrated.
>
> "It won't hit my zone! Should I adjust? Chase it?"
>
> The Cartographer looked up from his maps.
>
> "I don't chase price. Never have.
>
> I mark the levels that matter—where history says attention is warranted. Then I wait.
>
> Price always comes to the levels eventually. Maybe not today. Maybe not this week. But eventually.
>
> Chasing price means abandoning the map. Adjusting levels to fit desire means lying to yourself.
>
> My job isn't to catch every move. It's to be ready when price comes to MY levels. On MY terms.
>
> That requires patience. The most difficult skill.
>
> But the Cartographer who waits at the right levels catches the best moves."
