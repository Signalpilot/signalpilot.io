Auction Market Theory: Markets exist to facilitate trade.

Price moves UP to find sellers.
Price moves DOWN to find buyers.

When both are satisfied, price balances.
When one side dominates, price trends.

It's an auction. Always has been.

Auction Market Theory 📊

THE CORE CONCEPT:
Markets exist to facilitate trade between buyers and sellers

PRICE DISCOVERY:

📈 PRICE RISES
◾ Searching for sellers
◾ Buyers willing to pay more
◾ Continues until sellers appear

📉 PRICE FALLS
◾ Searching for buyers
◾ Sellers accepting less
◾ Continues until buyers appear

⚖️ BALANCE (Range)
◾ Buyers and sellers agree on value
◾ Price rotates around fair value
◾ Low volatility, acceptance

⚡ IMBALANCE (Trend)
◾ One side dominates
◾ Price searching for counterparty
◾ High volatility, rejection

THREE APPROACHES TO RISK:

😨 AVOIDING RISK
◾ Never taking trades
◾ Paralyzed by fear
◾ No opportunity seized

🎰 IGNORING RISK
◾ Trading recklessly
◾ No stop losses
◾ Inevitable blow-up

⚖️ MANAGING RISK
◾ Calculated position sizes
◾ Defined stop losses
◾ Risk:reward assessed
◾ Sustainable trading

Risk is the price of opportunity.
Pay it wisely.
