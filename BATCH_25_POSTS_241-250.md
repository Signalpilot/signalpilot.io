**Format:** Carousel (8 slides)

**Slide 1 - Hook:**
> ⚠️ WHY MOST INDICATORS FAIL
> It's not the indicator. It's how it's used.

**Slide 2 - Mistake 1:**
> ❌ TREATING LAG AS PREDICTION
> → Moving averages confirm, they don't predict
> → RSI "overbought" doesn't mean reversal

**Slide 3 - Mistake 2:**
> ❌ IGNORING MARKET REGIME
> → Trend indicators fail in ranges
> → Range indicators fail in trends

**Slide 4 - Mistake 3:**
> ❌ INDICATOR OVERLOAD
> → 10 indicators = 10 conflicting signals
> → More isn't better

**Slide 5 - Solution:**
> What works instead:
> ✅ Understand what each indicator measures
> ✅ Match indicator to market condition
> ✅ Use for confluence, not signals

**Slide 6 - Key Point:**
> Indicators inform.
