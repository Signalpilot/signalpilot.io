A hammer at resistance means nothing.
A hammer at support means something.

Patterns don't exist in isolation.

Price Action Context 📍

THE MISTAKE:
"I saw a hammer, so I bought"

THE TRUTH:
Patterns mean NOTHING without context

CONTEXT FACTORS:

📍 WHERE
At support? At resistance? Mid-range?

📍 TREND
With trend? Against trend? No trend?

📍 TIMEFRAME
Daily hammer > 5m hammer

📍 VOLUME
High volume confirmation? Low volume weakness?

📍 STRUCTURE
Key level? Random area?

SAME PATTERN, DIFFERENT MEANING:
◾ Hammer at support = Bullish potential
◾ Hammer at resistance = Probably nothing
◾ Hammer mid-trend = Continuation?

◾ Letting winners run
◾ Accepting small gains
◾ Taking breaks

GREED LOOKS LIKE:
◾ Forcing trades
◾ Oversizing positions
◾ Moving targets further
◾ Not taking profits
◾ "Just one more trade"

The market keeps score.

**Source:** https://docs.signalpilot.io/janus-atlas-v10

Fresh level: Never been retested.
Tested level: Already touched multiple times.

Fresh vs Tested Levels 🗺️

FRESH LEVEL:
◾ Created but never retested
◾ "Unused" support/resistance
◾ Often stronger reaction
◾ More orders waiting there

TESTED LEVEL:
◾ Already touched 2+ times
◾ Some orders already filled
◾ May hold or may break
◾ Watch for weakening

WHY IT MATTERS:

✅ FRESH LEVEL TRADE
Higher probability
Cleaner reaction expected
Tighter stop possible

⚠️ TESTED LEVEL TRADE
Lower probability
May chop around
Need more confirmation

Janus Atlas marks both. Know the difference.

The open is chaos. Or opportunity. Depending on your approach.

Option 1: Trade the opening range breakout
Option 2: Fade the opening spike
Option 3: Wait 30 minutes for direction

Don't trade the open blindly. Have a strategy.

Trading the Open 🔔

THE OPEN IS VOLATILE
Most volume, most emotion, most traps

STRATEGY 1: OPENING RANGE BREAKOUT
◾ Wait for first 15-30 min range
◾ Trade breakout of that range
◾ Direction often continues

STRATEGY 2: FADE THE SPIKE
◾ Opening often overshoots
◾ Wait for exhaustion
◾ Fade back toward VWAP

STRATEGY 3: WAIT FOR CLARITY
◾ Skip first 30 minutes entirely
◾ Let the chaos settle
◾ Trade when direction is clear

RULES FOR THE OPEN:
◾ Smaller size (volatility is high)
◾ Wider stops (noise is extreme)
◾ Have a plan BEFORE the bell

Optimal Trade Entry (OTE) 🎯

WHAT IS OTE?
The zone between 62-79% Fibonacci retracement

WHY THIS ZONE?

📍 DEEP ENOUGH
Good risk:reward ratio
Entry closer to stop

📍 NOT TOO DEEP
Trend structure still intact
Higher probability hold

📍 GOLDILOCKS ZONE
Not too shallow (poor R:R)
Not too deep (trend broken)

HOW TO USE:
1. Identify impulse move
2. Draw Fibonacci retracement
3. Look for entry at 62-79% zone
4. Confirm with price action
5. Stop below the low
