The Myth of the Perfect Setup 🦄

THE TRAP:
"I'll trade when everything aligns perfectly"

THE REALITY:
Perfect setups don't exist.

EVERY TRADE HAS:
◾ Some flaws
◾ Some risk
◾ Some doubt
◾ Some uncertainty

WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS:
◾ Good enough setup (meets criteria)
◾ Proper risk management
◾ Consistent execution
◾ Accept imperfection

THE MATH:
60% of "good" setups = Profitable over time
0% of "perfect" setups taken = $0

Good enough + Risk management = Success

Judas Swing 🗡️

WHAT IS IT?
A fake move at session open designed to trap traders

HOW IT WORKS:

1️⃣ SESSION OPENS
Price moves aggressively one direction

2️⃣ TRADERS REACT
"It's breaking out!"
Longs/shorts pile in

3️⃣ LIQUIDITY GRABBED
Stop losses triggered
Orders filled

4️⃣ REVERSAL
Price moves the OPPOSITE way
True direction revealed

WHY "JUDAS"?
Named after the betrayal
Price betrays early traders

HOW TO AVOID:
◾ Don't chase the open
◾ Wait for manipulation to complete
◾ Trade the reversal, not the fake

When Your Strategy Stops Working 🔧

BEFORE YOU ABANDON IT:

❓ IS IT THE STRATEGY OR YOU?
◾ Are you following rules exactly?
◾ Any emotional decisions?
◾ Execution errors?

❓ HAS THE REGIME CHANGED?
◾ Was it trending, now ranging?
◾ Volatility different?
◾ Strategy may need different regime

❓ IS IT JUST A LOSING STREAK?
◾ All strategies have drawdowns
◾ 10 losses in a row is possible
◾ Check if within normal variance

WHAT TO DO:
◾ Reduce size temporarily
◾ Paper trade while diagnosing
◾ Review recent trades closely
◾ Compare to backtest results

Don't abandon too quick. Don't drown either.
