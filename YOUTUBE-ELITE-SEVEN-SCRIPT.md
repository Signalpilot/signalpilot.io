### [0:00 - 2:00] HOOK + PROBLEM STATEMENT

**[VISUAL: Fast cuts of cluttered charts, indicator chaos, blown accounts, frustrated traders]**

**NARRATOR:**

"$47,000.

That's how much I lost before I realized the truth about trading indicators.

**[VISUAL: Screenshot of losing trades, account drawdown]**

I had twelve indicators on my chart. RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, three different moving averages, a volume indicator I didn't understand, and four premium indicators I paid $500 for.

One said buy. Another said sell. A third one just... changed its mind. Literally — the signal that was there yesterday? Gone today.

That's called repainting. And here's what nobody tells you when they're selling you indicators:

Most indicators are built to SELL, not to WORK.

They're designed to look perfect on screenshots. Perfect on replays. And absolutely terrible in live trading — when it actually matters.

**[VISUAL: Side-by-side — repainting indicator before/after]**

I know because I was that trader. Stacking indicators. Chasing signals. Wondering why what looked perfect in hindsight kept destroying me in real-time.

So after years of losses and frustration, we asked a different question:

What if indicators were built by traders who actually trade? What if they were designed around how markets ACTUALLY move — accumulation, markup, distribution, decline — not how indicator salesmen want them to look?

What if they couldn't repaint? What if they showed you what smart money is doing, not just what price did yesterday?

That question became SignalPilot. And these seven indicators... we call them The Elite Seven.

**[VISUAL: Clean chart with SignalPilot indicators — elegant, uncluttered]**

In the next 45 minutes, I'm going to show you exactly what each one does, how they work under the hood, and how thousands of traders are using them to finally see the market clearly."

---

### [1:30 - 2:30] WHO THIS IS FOR

**NARRATOR:**

"Before we dive in, let's be clear about who this is for.

This video is for traders who:

- Are tired of indicator chaos and want ONE cohesive system
- Have been burned by repainting indicators that look great on replays but fail live
- Understand that markets move in cycles — accumulation, markup, distribution, decline
- Want tools that show them WHAT smart money is doing, not just what price did yesterday
- Are willing to learn the WHY behind signals, not just blindly follow arrows

If you're looking for a magic button that prints money... this isn't it. No tool can do that.

But if you want professional-grade instruments that give you an EDGE — that show you what most retail traders can't see — keep watching.

Because in the next thirty minutes, I'm going to show you exactly what each indicator does, how it works under the hood, and how they combine into one unified system."

---

### [2:30 - 5:30] THE PHILOSOPHY (Why We Built This)

**[VISUAL: Wyckoff accumulation/distribution diagram, smart money vs retail visualization]**

**NARRATOR:**

"Before I show you the indicators, you need to understand the philosophy behind them. Because these aren't random tools thrown together — they're built on a specific framework for how markets actually work.

**The Core Belief: Markets Move in Cycles**

Every market — stocks, crypto, forex, futures — moves through the same phases:

1. **Accumulation** — Smart money quietly buying while everyone else is scared
2. **Markup** — The uptrend begins, momentum kicks in
3. **Distribution** — Smart money quietly selling while everyone else is greedy
4. **Decline** — Gravity reclaims price

This isn't new. Richard Wyckoff documented this over a hundred years ago. Institutions still operate this way today.

The problem? Most indicators ignore this completely.

They give you lagging moving average crossovers. They show you RSI is 'overbought' — as if that means anything during a markup phase. They trigger buy signals right as distribution is ending.

**Our Approach: Phase-Aware Trading**

Every indicator in The Elite Seven is designed to answer ONE question:

*Where are we in the cycle?*

Because the right strategy in accumulation is WRONG in distribution. The right entry during markup is WRONG during decline.

**The Second Principle: Non-Repainting**

This is non-negotiable.

Every signal in SignalPilot is confirmed at bar close. Period. What you see historically is EXACTLY what you would have seen in real-time.

No magical hindsight. No signals that appear and disappear. No 'this indicator predicted everything perfectly' screenshots that would have bankrupted you live.

If you've ever backtested an indicator, thought it was amazing, then watched it fail miserably in live trading... you've experienced repainting. We built SignalPilot specifically to solve that problem.

**The Third Principle: Confluence Over Conviction**

One indicator saying 'buy' means nothing.

Five indicators aligned? Now we're talking.

The Elite Seven are designed to work TOGETHER. Each one sees the market from a different angle. When they agree, conviction is high. When they disagree, you stay out.

That's the philosophy. Now let me show you the tools."

---

### [6:00 - 9:00] WHY NOT OTHER INDICATORS? (Competitor Comparison)

**[VISUAL: Comparison table graphic]**

**NARRATOR:**

"Before we dive into The Elite Seven, let's address the elephant in the room.

There are other premium indicator suites out there. LuxAlgo, TrendSpider, Trade Ideas, dozens of TradingView indicators promising the holy grail.

Why SignalPilot?

Let me be direct about what we've seen — and what traders tell us when they switch.

**[VISUAL: LuxAlgo logo]**

**LuxAlgo**

LuxAlgo makes beautiful indicators. Seriously. The visuals are clean.

But here's what we hear constantly from traders who've used both:

'The signals looked amazing on replays. Then I traded them live and got destroyed.'

The repainting issue. We've seen it in their reviews. We've heard it from traders in our community. Signals that appear, disappear, and reappear.

SignalPilot's difference: Every signal is confirmed at bar close. Period. What you see historically is exactly what you would have seen live. We've built our entire reputation on this.

**[VISUAL: TrendSpider logo]**

**TrendSpider**

TrendSpider is powerful. Genuinely impressive automation.

The problem? The learning curve is brutal. We've talked to traders who paid for TrendSpider and gave up after two weeks because they couldn't figure out how to use it effectively.

SignalPilot's difference: Usable out of the box. Our presets work immediately. You can go deep into customization if you want — but you don't have to. Start trading the same day you install.

**[VISUAL: Trade Ideas logo]**

**Trade Ideas**

Trade Ideas is institutional-grade scanning. If you're a professional day trader with a $50,000+ account, it might make sense.

At $167/month for their standard plan — or $2,000/year — it's priced for institutions, not retail traders building their edge.

SignalPilot's difference: Professional-grade analysis at a fraction of the cost. You don't need a five-figure account to afford professional tools.

**[VISUAL: Generic 'premium indicator' screenshots]**

**Random TradingView Indicators**

The TradingView marketplace is full of indicators that cost $30-50/month and promise 90% win rates.

Red flag. Massive red flag.

Any indicator promising specific win rates is either lying, repainting, or curve-fitted to historical data. None of those help you in live trading.

SignalPilot's difference: We don't promise win rates. We give you information. What smart money is doing. Where you are in the cycle. Where key levels are. YOU make the decision. The tool gives you clarity — not false promises.

**The Bottom Line:**

| Feature | SignalPilot | LuxAlgo | TrendSpider | Trade Ideas |
|---------|-------------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Non-repainting | ✅ Verified | ⚠️ Reports of issues | ✅ | ✅ |
| Ease of use | ✅ Immediate | ✅ Good | ❌ Steep curve | ⚠️ Complex |
| Market cycle focus | ✅ Core design | ❌ Not primary | ❌ Not primary | ❌ Not primary |
| Multi-indicator system | ✅ 7 integrated | ✅ Multiple | ✅ Multiple | ✅ Multiple |
| Price | $$  | $$ | $$$ | $$$$ |

We're not here to trash competitors. Some traders use LuxAlgo and love it. Some swear by TrendSpider.

But if you want:
- Guaranteed non-repainting signals
- A system built around market cycles and smart money
- Tools that work together as ONE cohesive system
- Usability without a PhD in technical analysis

That's what we built. Now let me show you exactly how it works."

### [9:00 - 11:00] THE ELITE SEVEN OVERVIEW

**[VISUAL: All 7 indicator icons/logos displayed with hierarchy]**

**NARRATOR:**

"The Elite Seven are organized into a hierarchy — each with a specific role in your trading decisions.

**At the top: The Sovereign**
- **Pentarch** — The cycle phase detector. This is the commander of the system. It tells you WHERE you are in the market cycle.

**The Council of Four:**
- **Volume Oracle** — The Prophet. Reveals whether smart money is accumulating or distributing.
- **Janus Atlas** — The Cartographer. Auto-plots 60+ level types so you know WHERE price will react.
- **Plutus Flow** — The Scales. Measures hidden buying and selling pressure through OBV analysis.
- **OmniDeck** — The Commander. Unifies 10 trading systems into one overlay.

**The Support:**
- **Augury Grid** — The Watchman. Scans multiple symbols and timeframes to find the best opportunities.
- **Harmonic Oscillator** — The Arbiter. A 7-component voting system that confirms momentum and exhaustion.

Think of it this way:

Pentarch tells you the PHASE.
Volume Oracle tells you the PLAYERS.
Janus Atlas tells you the LEVELS.
Plutus Flow tells you the PRESSURE.
OmniDeck gives you the CONTEXT.
Augury Grid finds you the OPPORTUNITIES.
Harmonic Oscillator gives you the CONFIRMATION.

Now let's break down each one."

---

### [7:30 - 11:30] INDICATOR 1: PENTARCH (The Sovereign)

**[VISUAL: Pentarch on chart showing all 5 signal types with clean annotations]**

**NARRATOR:**

"Pentarch is the cornerstone of SignalPilot. If you only use ONE indicator from the suite, this is the one.

**What It Does:**

Pentarch maps the 5-phase market cycle directly onto your chart. It tells you — in real-time — whether the market is in:

- Accumulation (potential bottom forming)
- Markup (uptrend in progress)
- Distribution (potential top forming)
- Or Decline (downtrend in progress)

**The 5 Signals:**

Let me walk you through each signal and what it means:

**[VISUAL: TD signal highlighted]**

**1. TD — Touchdown (Purple, Below Candle)**

This is the early-cycle reversal signal. It fires when Pentarch detects selling exhaustion.

Think of it as: 'The selling is drying up. Smart money may be stepping in.'

You'll see TD signals after extended downtrends, often near major support levels. It doesn't mean 'buy now' — it means 'start paying attention, the cycle may be turning.'

**[VISUAL: IGN signal highlighted]**

**2. IGN — Ignition (Teal, Below Candle)**

This is the breakout confirmation. When you see Ignition, the markup phase is beginning with conviction.

TD says 'the bottom might be in.'
IGN says 'the bottom IS in. Momentum is shifting.'

This is often the safest entry point — you've got confirmation that the cycle has turned.

**[VISUAL: WRN signal highlighted]**

**3. WRN — Warning (Yellow, Above Candle)**

Here's where most traders get destroyed.

Warning fires during uptrends when Pentarch detects early weakness. Price might still be going up. You might still be profitable. But something underneath is changing.

Think of it as: 'The easy part of this move is over. Tighten your stops or take some profit.'

Most traders ignore warnings because they're greedy. They watch their profits evaporate. Warning exists to protect you from that.

**[VISUAL: CAP signal highlighted]**

**4. CAP — Climax (Orange, Above Candle)**

This is late-cycle exhaustion.

Climax fires when price is extended AND volume is spiking — classic blow-off top behavior. When you see Climax, the market is often making its final push before a reversal.

It doesn't mean 'short immediately' — but it means 'this is NOT the time to be adding longs.'

**[VISUAL: BDN signal highlighted]**

**5. BDN — Breakdown (Red, Above Candle)**

The opposite of Ignition. Breakdown confirms that structure has failed and the decline phase is underway.

If you're still holding longs when you see Breakdown... you should have listened to Warning.

**How It Works Under the Hood:**

Pentarch isn't just one calculation. It's a 4-layer detection system:

1. **Regime Classification** — Is the overall structure bullish, bearish, or neutral?
2. **Pilot Line Distance** — How far is price from its trend anchor? (Oversold vs overbought)
3. **NanoFlow Momentum** — A -100 to +100 scale measuring directional conviction
4. **Bar Close Confirmation** — Signals ONLY fire at bar close. No mid-bar fakeouts.

All four layers must align before a signal appears. That's why Pentarch signals are rare but meaningful.

**[VISUAL: Chart showing Pilot Line, Regime Bars, NanoFlow panel]**

You'll also see three components on your chart:
- The **Pilot Line** — A dynamic trend reference
- **Regime Bars** — Candle colors showing the current phase (green = bullish, red = bearish, gray = neutral)
- **NanoFlow** — A momentum oscillator in a separate panel

These aren't just decoration. They give you context between signals."

---

### [11:30 - 15:00] INDICATOR 2: VOLUME ORACLE (The Prophet)

**[VISUAL: Volume Oracle dashboard on chart]**

**NARRATOR:**

"Volume doesn't lie. But most traders don't know how to read it.

Volume Oracle solves that problem.

**What It Does:**

Volume Oracle is a regime-based volume intelligence system. It tells you whether smart money is accumulating... or distributing.

Most volume indicators just show you bars going up and down. That's useless.

Volume Oracle classifies the market into three regimes:

**[VISUAL: Green ACCUMULATION regime]**

**ACCUMULATION (Green)**

Bullish conditions. Smart money is buying. Volume patterns suggest institutional positioning to the long side.

When you see Accumulation regime + Pentarch TD or IGN signals... that's confluence.

**[VISUAL: Red DISTRIBUTION regime]**

**DISTRIBUTION (Red)**

Bearish conditions. Smart money is selling. The volume footprint shows institutional positioning to the short side.

When you see Distribution regime + Pentarch WRN or CAP signals... it's time to protect profits or look for shorts.

**[VISUAL: Gray NEUTRAL regime]**

**NEUTRAL (Gray)**

No clear directional bias. This is when you stay patient. The market hasn't made up its mind yet.

**The 5 Backend Systems:**

Under the hood, Volume Oracle runs five detection systems:

1. **Market Structure Detection** — Tracking swing highs and lows (HH/HL vs LH/LL)
2. **Volume Footprint Classification** — Categorizing bars as Momentum, Absorption, Spike, or Normal
3. **Regime Stability Index** — How often is the regime flipping? Stable = high conviction
4. **Confluence Scoring** — Multi-factor support evaluation
5. **Signal Density Tracking** — Are signals clustering? That often precedes big moves

**Quality Ratings:**

Not all signals are equal. Volume Oracle grades each setup:

- **Elite (80-100%)** — Highest probability. Multiple factors aligned.
- **Premium (60-79%)** — Strong setup. Worth taking with proper sizing.
- **Standard (40-59%)** — Acceptable. May need additional confirmation.

**Built-In Position Management:**

Volume Oracle also calculates stops and targets based on ATR:

- Stop Loss: 1.5× ATR
- Target 1: 2.0× ATR (take 50% off)
- Target 2: 3.5× ATR (let the rest run)
- Auto-breakeven: Triggered at 1.0× ATR profit

These aren't suggestions — they're mathematically derived from volatility."

---

### [15:00 - 18:30] INDICATOR 3: JANUS ATLAS (The Cartographer)

**[VISUAL: Janus Atlas showing multiple level types on a clean chart]**

**NARRATOR:**

"Where will price react?

That's the question every trader asks. Janus Atlas answers it.

**What It Does:**

Janus Atlas automatically plots over 60 types of significant levels across multiple timeframes. No more drawing lines manually. No more missing key levels because you forgot to check the weekly chart.

**The 9 Level Categories:**

**[VISUAL: Each category highlighted as mentioned]**

**1. Classic Timeframe Levels**
Daily highs, lows, opens, closes. Weekly highs, lows. Monthly levels. Previous day, previous week, previous month. Plus pivot points — standard, Fibonacci, and Camarilla.

These are the levels institutions watch. If you're not tracking them, you're trading blind.

**2. VWAP Family**
Volume Weighted Average Price — but not just daily VWAP.

Janus Atlas plots:
- Daily VWAP (dVWAP)
- Weekly VWAP (wVWAP)
- Monthly VWAP (mVWAP)
- Quarterly VWAP (qVWAP)
- Yearly VWAP (yVWAP)

Plus standard deviation bands at ±1σ and ±2σ.

Institutions execute around VWAP. If you're not watching it, you're ignoring where the big money operates.

**3. Volume Profile Levels**
- POC (Point of Control) — Where the most volume traded
- VAH (Value Area High) — Upper boundary of fair value
- VAL (Value Area Low) — Lower boundary of fair value

These levels act like magnets. Price tends to return to them.

**4. Naked POC (nPOC)**
Previous session POCs that price never retested. These are unfinished business. Highly magnetic.

**5. Session Levels**
Asian session high/low. London session high/low. New York session high/low.

If you trade forex or futures, these are essential. Each session has its own character.

**6. Market Structure Levels**
Swing highs and lows. Break of Structure (BOS) points. Change of Character (CHoCH) levels.

This is the backbone of smart money concepts — and Janus Atlas plots them automatically.

**7. Opening Range**
The high, low, and midpoint of the first X minutes of the session. Configurable from 5 to 60 minutes.

Opening range breakout is one of the oldest strategies in trading. Janus Atlas makes it effortless.

**8. Gap Levels**
Daily gaps. Weekend gaps. CME gaps for crypto. Plus gap fill detection — showing you when a gap has been filled and when it's still open.

**9. Fair Value Gaps (FVG)**
Bullish and bearish imbalances in price. These are areas where aggressive buying or selling created inefficiencies that price often returns to fill.

**Confluence Zones:**

Here's where it gets powerful.

When multiple levels cluster in the same area, Janus Atlas highlights them as confluence zones. Three or more levels stacking at the same price? That's institutional territory.

**Distance Tables:**

A small info panel shows you how far price is from key levels — in both points and percentage. You'll never be surprised by a level again."

---

### [18:30 - 21:30] INDICATOR 4: PLUTUS FLOW (The Scales)

**[VISUAL: Plutus Flow panel showing OBV line, Flow Ribbon, bands, and divergence markers]**

**NARRATOR:**

"On-Balance Volume is one of the oldest indicators in trading. Joe Granville created it in the 1960s.

The concept is simple: track cumulative volume. If price closes up, add the volume. If price closes down, subtract it.

The insight is powerful: volume precedes price.

But most OBV implementations are too basic to be useful. Plutus Flow changes that.

**What It Does:**

Plutus Flow is a 4-layer OBV system that reveals hidden buying and selling pressure — and catches divergences before they play out.

**The 4 Layers:**

**[VISUAL: Each layer annotated]**

**Layer 1: The OBV Line**
Cumulative volume tracking. Rising = net buying pressure. Falling = net selling pressure.

**Layer 2: Flow Ribbon**
A smoothed trend wrapper around OBV. Green = bullish flow. Red = bearish flow.

When OBV crosses above the ribbon, momentum is shifting bullish. Below = bearish.

**Layer 3: Statistical Bands (±2σ)**
These show you when OBV reaches extreme levels — two standard deviations from the mean.

Extreme readings often precede reversals. Not immediately, but they tell you pressure is unsustainable.

**Layer 4: Divergence Detection**
This is the core feature.

Plutus Flow automatically detects four types of divergences:

**[VISUAL: Each divergence type shown]**

**Bullish Divergence:**
Price makes a LOWER LOW. OBV makes a HIGHER LOW.

Translation: Price is falling but selling pressure is decreasing. The move is losing steam. Reversal up likely.

**Bearish Divergence:**
Price makes a HIGHER HIGH. OBV makes a LOWER HIGH.

Translation: Price is rising but buying pressure is decreasing. The move is losing steam. Reversal down likely.

**Hidden Bullish:**
Price makes a HIGHER LOW. OBV makes a LOWER LOW.

This suggests continuation of an uptrend after a pullback.

**Hidden Bearish:**
Price makes a LOWER HIGH. OBV makes a HIGHER HIGH.

Continuation of a downtrend after a bounce.

**Extreme Zone Signals:**

You'll see two types of dots:
- **White dots** — OBV entering the ±2σ extreme zone
- **Yellow dots** — OBV exiting the extreme zone

White dot = pressure is extreme, be alert.
Yellow dot = pressure is releasing, move may be starting.

**Why This Matters:**

Divergences are leading indicators. Price hasn't reversed yet — but the pressure underneath is already changing.

Most traders only see price. Plutus Flow lets you see beneath the surface."

---

### [21:30 - 25:00] INDICATOR 5: OMNIDECK (The Commander)

**[VISUAL: OmniDeck showing multiple systems — TD Sequential, Squeeze, Liquidity Sweeps, etc.]**

**NARRATOR:**

"What if you could have ten professional trading systems... in one indicator?

That's OmniDeck.

**What It Does:**

OmniDeck unifies ten different trading systems into one cohesive overlay. Instead of cluttering your chart with ten indicators, you get one that intelligently displays what's relevant.

**The 10 Systems:**

**[VISUAL: Each system shown as mentioned]**

**1. TD Sequential**
Tom DeMark's exhaustion counter. Numbers 1-9 appear on candles, tracking exhaustion sequences. A completed 9-count often precedes reversals.

**2. Squeeze Detector**
Volatility compression detection. When Bollinger Bands move inside Keltner Channels, the market is coiling. The squeeze release often produces explosive moves.

You'll see colored dots: building squeeze, releasing squeeze, and direction of the release.

**3. Liquidity Sweeps**
This is where retail traders get hunted.

OmniDeck marks sweeps with:
- 💧 — Liquidity sweep detected
- 🩸 — Aggressive sweep (stop hunt confirmed)

When you see these markers, institutions just grabbed liquidity. If price reclaims the level, that's often a high-probability entry.

**4. EMA Trio**
The classic 50, 100, and 200 EMAs. Simple but essential. The relationship between these tells you the macro trend.

Above all three = strong uptrend. Below all three = strong downtrend. Tangled = ranging.

**5. SuperTrend**
An adaptive trend-following ribbon. Green = bullish trend in control. Red = bearish trend in control.

SuperTrend is excellent for trailing stops. It adjusts to volatility automatically.

**6. BMSB (Bull Market Support Band)**
The 20 SMA + 21 EMA combo. In bull markets, pullbacks tend to find support here. In bear markets, rallies tend to fail here.

Simple but surprisingly effective.

**7. Regime Box**
Background coloring showing the current market regime:
- Green background = bullish structure
- Red background = bearish structure
- Gray background = neutral/ranging

This syncs with Pentarch's regime classification for consistency.

**8. Supply/Demand Zones**
Automatically detected zones where institutional buying or selling likely occurred.

Quality rated with stars:
- ⭐ = Standard zone
- ⭐⭐ = Strong zone
- ⭐⭐⭐ = Elite zone (multiple touches, held multiple times)

These zones don't repaint. Once plotted, they stay until broken.

**9. Candlestick Patterns**
OmniDeck recognizes 16 Relative Candle Strength (RCS) patterns:
- Hammer, Inverted Hammer
- Engulfing (Bullish/Bearish)
- Morning Star, Evening Star
- Doji variants
- And more

Patterns are marked when they form at significant levels — not randomly in the middle of nowhere.

**10. Meta Tools**
The integration layer. This coordinates all nine systems, manages visual priority, and calculates the confluence score.

**The Confluence Score Panel:**

In the corner, you'll see a 1-10 scale showing how many systems are aligned.

- 1-3: No edge. Stay out.
- 4-6: Moderate alignment. Possible trade with tight management.
- 7-10: Strong confluence. High conviction setup.

**38 Built-In Alerts:**

OmniDeck has 38 configurable alerts across all systems. Squeeze firing. Liquidity sweep detected. TD 9 complete. Pattern at key level.

Set them once, then let the system notify you."

---

### [25:00 - 27:30] INDICATOR 6: AUGURY GRID (The Watchman)

**[VISUAL: Augury Grid scanner table showing multiple symbols and timeframes]**

**NARRATOR:**

"You can have the best indicators in the world — but if you're watching the wrong chart, it doesn't matter.

Augury Grid solves the 'what should I be trading?' problem.

**What It Does:**

Augury Grid is a multi-symbol, multi-timeframe scanner. It watches 7 symbols across 3 timeframes — that's 21 different charts being analyzed simultaneously.

Then it ranks them by conviction so you know where to focus.

**How It Works:**

**[VISUAL: Scanner table with columns annotated]**

The primary signal engine uses MACD histogram crossovers as the trigger. But the signal only fires if it passes 15+ confluence filters:

- ADX above threshold (trend strength)
- Price relative to EMA 200 (macro trend)
- RSI confirmation (momentum)
- Volume confirmation (participation)
- And more

**The Display:**

Each row shows:
- **Rank** — Priority based on conviction score
- **Symbol** — The asset
- **Timeframe** — 15m, 1H, 4H, Daily, etc.
- **Bias** — Bull or Bear, with star ratings for strength
- **Time Active** — How long the signal has been valid
- **Entry Price** — Suggested entry
- **Stop Loss** — Calculated stop
- **Take Profit** — Target levels
- **Current P/L** — If you took the signal, how it's performing

**Multi-Timeframe Confluence:**

Here's the edge.

When the same symbol signals on multiple timeframes, Augury Grid marks it:
- 🔗 = Two timeframes agree
- 🔗🔗 = Three timeframes agree

Three-timeframe confluence is rare. When it appears, pay attention.

**Quality Scoring:**

Each signal gets a 0-100 conviction score based on how many filters it passed and how strongly.

High scores = higher probability. Low scores = more risk.

**Configurable Watchlists:**

You choose which 7 symbols to scan. Set it to your favorite stocks, your crypto portfolio, major forex pairs — whatever you trade.

Augury Grid becomes your personal assistant, watching everything while you focus on execution."

### [27:30 - 30:30] INDICATOR 7: HARMONIC OSCILLATOR (The Arbiter)

**[VISUAL: Harmonic Oscillator panel showing voting components and regime classification]**

**NARRATOR:**

"The final piece: Harmonic Oscillator.

Most oscillators give you ONE reading. RSI says overbought. Or oversold. That's it.

The problem? Single indicators fail all the time. RSI can stay overbought for weeks during a strong uptrend.

Harmonic Oscillator solves this with a voting system.

**What It Does:**

Seven components analyze momentum independently. Then they vote.

When most components agree, conviction is high. When they disagree, stay out.

**The 7 Voting Components:**

**[VISUAL: Each component shown]**

**1. RSI (Momentum-Aware)**
Not just 'above 70' or 'below 30.' Harmonic Oscillator's RSI considers direction AND whether we're in a trending or ranging environment.

**2. Stochastic RSI**
Smoothed stochastic with slope analysis. Looking at both the level AND the direction of change.

**3. MACD**
Histogram acceleration detection. Not just positive/negative — is it accelerating or decelerating?

**4. EMA Trend**
Price position relative to trend with slope analysis. Above a rising EMA = bullish vote. Below a falling EMA = bearish vote.

**5. Momentum**
Rate of change analysis. Is price gaining velocity or losing it?

**6. Volume**
Is volume confirming the move? High volume on up candles = bullish vote. High volume on down candles = bearish vote.

**7. Divergence Zone**
Extreme zone detection with price confirmation. When price reaches statistical extremes AND shows reversal signs, this component votes for mean reversion.

**The Voting Result:**

Each component casts a vote: Bullish, Bearish, or Neutral.

The combined votes determine the regime:

**[VISUAL: Regime display]**

- **TRENDING▲** (6-7 bullish votes) — Strong upward momentum. Go with it.
- **TRENDING▼** (6-7 bearish votes) — Strong downward momentum. Don't fight it.
- **BIAS▲** (4-5 bullish votes) — Moderate bullish lean. Tradeable with caution.
- **BIAS▼** (4-5 bearish votes) — Moderate bearish lean. Tradeable with caution.
- **RANGING** (0-3 votes either way) — No consensus. Stay out or trade the range.

**Signal Modes:**

You can configure sensitivity:
- **Conservative (6+ votes)** — Fewer signals, higher probability
- **Balanced (5+ votes)** — Middle ground
- **Aggressive (4+ votes)** — More signals, more noise

Most traders should start with Balanced.

**When to Use Harmonic Oscillator:**

It's the CONFIRMATION layer.

Pentarch gives you a signal. Volume Oracle shows the regime. Janus Atlas shows the level.

Before you enter... check Harmonic Oscillator.

Is it aligned? Take the trade. Is it conflicting? Wait for clarity."

### [31:00 - 34:00] HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER

**[VISUAL: All 7 indicators on one chart (or split screen showing workflow)]**

**NARRATOR:**

"Now let's put it all together.

The Elite Seven aren't designed to be used in isolation. They're designed as a SYSTEM.

Here's the workflow:

**[VISUAL: Flowchart or step-by-step animation]**

**Step 1: Scan with Augury Grid**
'What should I be trading today?'

Open Augury Grid. Look for high-conviction signals, especially with multi-timeframe confluence. This narrows your focus.

**Step 2: Check the Phase with Pentarch**
'Where are we in the cycle?'

Go to that chart. What's Pentarch showing? TD? IGN? WRN? CAP?

If you're looking to buy and Pentarch just printed CAP... that's a conflict. Move on.

**Step 3: Confirm the Regime with Volume Oracle**
'What is smart money doing?'

Is Volume Oracle showing Accumulation or Distribution?

Buying in an Accumulation regime = going with smart money.
Buying in a Distribution regime = fighting smart money.

**Step 4: Find Your Level with Janus Atlas**
'Where should I enter? Where should I put my stop?'

Look for confluence zones. Multiple levels stacking together. That's your area.

**Step 5: Check Pressure with Plutus Flow**
'Is there hidden divergence?'

If you're buying and Plutus Flow shows bearish divergence forming... wait.

If you're buying and Plutus Flow shows bullish divergence... you might have a home run.

**Step 6: Get Context with OmniDeck**
'What else is happening?'

Is there a squeeze building? Did price just sweep liquidity? Is there a supply zone overhead?

OmniDeck fills in the context.

**Step 7: Confirm with Harmonic Oscillator**
'Is momentum aligned?'

Final check. If Harmonic Oscillator is voting 5-6 components in your direction... green light.

If it's conflicting... either wait or reduce size.

**The Power of Confluence:**

When five or six of these indicators align... that's a high-probability setup.

When they conflict... you wait.

Most retail traders take every mediocre setup. Professionals wait for confluence. The Elite Seven make confluence visible."

### [34:30 - 38:30] REAL TRADE WALKTHROUGH (Live Example)

**[VISUAL: Actual chart with all indicators visible, walking through in real-time]**

**NARRATOR:**

"Theory is great. But you came here to see how this actually works. Let me walk you through a real trade setup — step by step.

**[VISUAL: Augury Grid scanner]**

**Step 1: The Scanner Flags an Opportunity**

I open Augury Grid. It's showing me 21 scans across my watchlist. And right here — ETH on the 4-hour timeframe — I'm seeing a bullish signal with a conviction score of 78.

Even better: the 1-hour is also bullish. That's multi-timeframe confluence. The 🔗 icon confirms it.

Let's investigate.

**[VISUAL: Switch to ETH 4H chart with Pentarch]**

**Step 2: What's Pentarch Saying?**

I pull up the chart. First thing I check — Pentarch.

And look at this. Three bars ago, we got a TD signal — Touchdown. That purple marker below the candle. Pentarch detected selling exhaustion.

The regime bars just turned from red to gray. We're transitioning out of decline.

This is exactly what I want to see if I'm looking to buy. The cycle is potentially turning.

**[VISUAL: Volume Oracle panel]**

**Step 3: What's Smart Money Doing?**

Now Volume Oracle. What's the regime?

It JUST flipped to Accumulation — that green background. The regime was Distribution for the past two weeks. Now it's showing early accumulation.

The quality rating? Premium — 72%. Not Elite, but solid.

Smart money appears to be positioning long. I'm getting interested.

**[VISUAL: Janus Atlas levels]**

**Step 4: Where's My Level?**

Janus Atlas is showing me something beautiful here.

Look at this confluence zone. We've got:
- Weekly VWAP sitting at $2,847
- Previous week's low at $2,852
- A naked POC from three days ago at $2,841

Three major levels within $11 of each other. That's institutional territory.

And where is price right now? $2,863 — just above the zone.

If this is real accumulation, that zone should hold as support.

**[VISUAL: Plutus Flow panel]**

**Step 5: What's the Hidden Pressure?**

Plutus Flow is the confirmation I need.

And here it is — bullish divergence. Price made a lower low two days ago. But OBV made a HIGHER low. The selling pressure was decreasing even as price dropped.

Classic smart money accumulation signature.

The Flow Ribbon just turned green. Momentum is shifting.

**[VISUAL: OmniDeck overlay]**

**Step 6: Context Check**

OmniDeck is giving me more confluence:
- TD Sequential count is at 8. One more down candle would complete a 9 — exhaustion signal.
- The squeeze detector shows we JUST released from a squeeze. Volatility is about to expand.
- No supply zone directly overhead until $3,100.

The path of least resistance is up.

**[VISUAL: Harmonic Oscillator]**

**Step 7: Final Confirmation**

Last check — Harmonic Oscillator.

It's showing BIAS▲ — 5 of 7 components voting bullish. Not a full TRENDING signal, but positive lean.

RSI is voting bullish. MACD is voting bullish. Volume is confirming. EMA trend is the main holdout — price is still below the 200.

5 out of 7. That's enough for me with all the other confluence.

**[VISUAL: Trade execution panel]**

**The Trade:**

Entry: $2,863 (current price, just above the confluence zone)
Stop Loss: $2,820 (below the confluence zone, 1.5× ATR)
Target 1: $2,950 (previous resistance, 2× ATR)
Target 2: $3,100 (supply zone, 3.5× ATR)

Risk: $43 per unit
Reward at T1: $87 (2:1 R:R)
Reward at T2: $237 (5.5:1 R:R)

Position size: Based on risking 1% of account.

**[VISUAL: Fast forward / time lapse of candles]**

**What Happened:**

Over the next 36 hours, price:
- Dipped to $2,849 (held the confluence zone perfectly)
- Bounced and hit Target 1 at $2,950 (took 50% off)
- Continued to $3,087 before pulling back

I moved stop to breakeven at Target 1. The remaining position either hits Target 2 or gets stopped at breakeven.

**That's the system.**

Not every trade works. But when five or six indicators align like this? The probability is in your favor.

And when they DON'T align? You skip the trade. That's equally important."

---

### [38:30 - 41:00] COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

**[VISUAL: Red X graphics, warning signs]**

**NARRATOR:**

"Before you start using The Elite Seven, let me save you from the mistakes I see traders make constantly.

**Mistake #1: Using Every Indicator on Every Chart**

You don't need all seven indicators active at once. Your chart will look like a Christmas tree.

Start with Pentarch. Add Volume Oracle. That's your foundation.

Layer in Janus Atlas for levels. Add others as you need specific information.

Most of my charts have 2-3 active at a time. I check the others when I need them.

**Mistake #2: Ignoring Conflicting Signals**

This is the big one.

Pentarch shows Ignition. You get excited. But Volume Oracle is still showing Distribution. Harmonic Oscillator is RANGING.

What do you do?

Most traders take the trade anyway because they want to be in the market.

The right answer: WAIT. Conflicting signals mean uncertainty. The edge comes from confluence, not from forcing trades.

**Mistake #3: Trading Signals Without Understanding the Phase**

A TD signal in the middle of a strong downtrend is NOT the same as a TD signal after an extended decline near major support.

Context matters.

Don't just trade the signal. Understand WHERE in the cycle you are, WHAT the market structure looks like, and WHETHER smart money is likely participating.

**Mistake #4: Skipping the Education**

The indicators are tools. They show you information.

But if you don't understand market cycles, smart money concepts, and why signals form... you're just following arrows blindly.

That works until it doesn't. Then you have no framework to adapt.

Spend time in the education hub. Read the lessons. Understand the WHY.

**Mistake #5: Over-Optimizing Settings**

The default settings work. We've tested them across thousands of charts.

I see traders spend weeks tweaking RSI periods from 14 to 13 to 12, looking for the 'perfect' setting.

There is no perfect setting. The edge comes from confluence and discipline, not from finding a magic number.

Start with defaults. Only adjust after you have significant screen time and understand what you're changing.

**Mistake #6: Expecting 100% Win Rate**

No indicator — not even seven indicators working together — will win every trade.

If The Elite Seven help you win 55% of your trades with a 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio... you're profitable.

If you expect every signal to work, you'll abandon the system after three losses in a row. That's exactly when discipline matters most.

Trading is a probability game. The system gives you an edge. You have to execute consistently to realize it."

---

### [41:00 - 43:30] FAQ: YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED

**[VISUAL: Question graphics, clean text overlays]**

**NARRATOR:**

"Let me answer the questions I get asked most often.

**'Do these indicators repaint?'**

No. Every signal in SignalPilot is confirmed at bar close. What you see historically is exactly what you would have seen in real-time.

This is non-negotiable for us. We built SignalPilot specifically because we were tired of repainting indicators.

You can verify this yourself: add any SignalPilot indicator to your chart and watch it in real-time. Signals only appear after the bar closes. They never change or disappear.

**'What markets do they work on?'**

Any market available on TradingView. Stocks, crypto, forex, futures, indices.

The underlying principles — market cycles, smart money behavior, volume analysis — are universal. They work on Bitcoin the same way they work on Apple or EUR/USD.

**'What timeframes work best?'**

The indicators work on any timeframe. But we recommend:
- Swing trading: 4H and Daily
- Day trading: 15m and 1H
- Scalping: 5m (with higher timeframe context)

Higher timeframes generally produce cleaner signals with less noise.

**'Do I need all seven indicators?'**

No. You can start with just Pentarch. Or Pentarch plus Volume Oracle.

The indicators are designed to work together, but they also function independently. Start with one or two, learn them deeply, then add more as needed.

**'How long does it take to learn?'**

Depends on your existing knowledge.

If you already understand market cycles and smart money concepts: a few days to a week to get comfortable with the signals.

If you're newer to trading: spend time in the education hub first. A few weeks to build the conceptual foundation, then another week or two with the indicators.

Don't rush. Screen time is irreplaceable.

**'What's the difference between the plans?'**

Monthly at $99/month gives you all 7 indicators with month-to-month flexibility. Great for trying it out.

Yearly at $699/year is the same features but saves you $489 — that's 41% off. Best value if you're committed.

Lifetime at $1,799 one-time is everything forever — all future updates, private Discord community, 200+ preset configurations, beta access, priority support. Limited to 350 total slots.

All plans come with a 7-day free trial — no credit card, full access. Plus a 7-day money-back guarantee if you subscribe and change your mind. And of course, full documentation and the free education hub.

**'Can I use these with other indicators?'**

Yes. Many traders use SignalPilot alongside their existing tools.

Common combinations: SignalPilot + VPVR (Volume Profile), SignalPilot + ICT concepts, SignalPilot + custom scripts.

The indicators play well with others. They're not a closed ecosystem."

### [43:30 - 45:00] GETTING STARTED + RESOURCES

**[VISUAL: Education hub, documentation, pricing plans, community screenshots]**

**NARRATOR:**

"So how do you get started?

**What Traders Are Saying:**

Before I give you the resources, let me share what actual users are saying on Trustpilot:

'This is the first time I feel like I've struck gold, literally.' — Xhesika L., verified Trustpilot review ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

'It has helped me understand the market cycles better.' — Arber L., verified Trustpilot review ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

'You can tell they are passionate about building this project.' — Axl F., verified Trustpilot review ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

'Top experience from dedicated devs.' — Artur Y., verified Trustpilot review ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

These aren't paid testimonials. Check our Trustpilot page yourself — link in the description.

We're not promising riches. We're delivering clarity. That's what traders tell us makes the difference.

**Free Resources:**

First, check out our free education hub at education.signalpilot.io.

We've built over 80 lessons covering everything from the basics of market cycles to advanced institutional order flow. No paywalls on the education. Learn the concepts before you decide if the tools are right for you.

Thousands of traders have gone through this curriculum. It's the foundation everything else builds on.

**Documentation:**

Full documentation for every indicator is at docs.signalpilot.io. Every setting explained. Every signal defined. Use cases and examples.

**The Indicators:**

The Elite Seven are available on TradingView. Three plan options:

- **Monthly ($99/month)** — All 7 indicators, future updates, 48-hour support. Month-to-month flexibility.
- **Yearly ($699/year)** — Same features, 41% savings ($489 off), 24-hour support. Best value.
- **Lifetime ($1,799 one-time)** — Everything forever. Private Discord, 200+ presets, beta access, priority support. Limited to 350 slots.

All plans include a 7-day free trial — use everything, no credit card required. And if you do subscribe and it's not for you, there's also a 7-day money-back guarantee. Zero risk either way.

Works on stocks, crypto, forex, indices, commodities.

Links are in the description.

**My Honest Recommendation:**

Don't buy anything yet.

Seriously.

Start with the free education hub. Go through the market cycles lessons. Understand smart money concepts. Learn why most indicators fail.

Then, if the philosophy resonates — if you want tools built on these principles — try Pentarch first. Paper trade with it for a week. See if it changes how you see the market.

If it does... the other six indicators will make even more sense.

The edge isn't in the tools. The edge is in understanding WHAT the tools are showing you and WHY.

The Elite Seven can give you institutional-grade information. But it's still up to you to execute."

---

### [45:00 - 46:00] CLOSING

**[VISUAL: Clean chart, SignalPilot logo, CTAs]**

**NARRATOR:**

"Let me leave you with this.

Markets are hard. Most traders lose. Not because they're stupid. Not because the markets are rigged. But because they're using retail tools that were designed to look good in screenshots — not to work in live trading.

The Elite Seven were built differently.

Built by traders who lost money to repainting indicators and said 'never again.'
Built on a framework of market cycles and smart money that's worked for a hundred years.
Built to show you WHAT is happening, WHERE to act, and WHY it matters.

They won't make you rich overnight. Nothing will. Anyone who promises that is lying.

But they can give you clarity. An edge. A system that makes sense — where the tools work together instead of against each other.

If that resonates... welcome to SignalPilot.

Start with the free education hub — link in the description. Go through the lessons. See if the philosophy clicks.

Then, if you're ready to see your charts differently... The Elite Seven will be waiting.

Thanks for watching. I'll see you in the charts."

# RECORDING TUTORIAL: How to Record in Pieces for CapCut

## The Strategy: Section-by-Section Recording

You don't record 46 minutes straight. You record each section separately, then stitch in CapCut.

### Step 1: Prep Your Recording Setup

**Screen Recording Software:**
- **Windows:** OBS Studio (free) or built-in Xbox Game Bar (Win+G)
- **Mac:** OBS Studio or built-in QuickTime
- **Recommended:** OBS Studio — free, powerful, records system audio

**OBS Settings for Quality:**
```
Output Resolution: 1920x1080
FPS: 30 (or 60 for smoother)
Encoder: x264 or NVENC (if you have NVIDIA GPU)
Bitrate: 6000-10000 kbps
Format: MP4 or MKV
Audio: 48kHz, 192kbps
```

**Voiceover Recording:**
- Use a separate audio track (OBS can do this)
- Or record voiceover separately in Audacity (free) for cleaner editing

### Step 2: The Recording Order

Record in this order (easiest to hardest):

**PHASE 1: Screen Recordings (No Voice)**
Record all TradingView clips FIRST, without talking. Just capture the visuals.

1. Open TradingView
2. Load chart with SignalPilot indicators
3. Find examples of each signal/feature
4. Record 15-45 second clips of each
5. Name files clearly: `01_pentarch_td_signal.mp4`, `02_pentarch_ign_signal.mp4`, etc.

**Tip:** Use TradingView's replay mode to find historical examples of signals.

**PHASE 2: Voiceover Recording**
Record voiceover in sections, matching the script timestamps:

| Recording Session | Script Sections | Duration |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------|
| Session 1 | Hook + Who This Is For + Philosophy | ~6 min |
| Session 2 | Competitor Comparison | ~3 min |
| Session 3 | Elite Seven Overview + Pentarch | ~6 min |
| Session 4 | Volume Oracle + Janus Atlas | ~7 min |
| Session 5 | Plutus Flow + OmniDeck | ~6.5 min |
| Session 6 | Augury Grid + Harmonic Oscillator | ~5.5 min |
| Session 7 | How They Work Together + Mid-roll CTA | ~3.5 min |
| Session 8 | Trade Walkthrough | ~4 min |
| Session 9 | Common Mistakes + FAQ | ~5 min |
| Session 10 | Getting Started + Closing | ~3 min |

**Recording Tips:**
- Read each section 2-3 times before recording
- Keep water nearby
- If you mess up, pause, then restart that sentence
- Speak slightly slower than conversational (YouTube viewers can speed up)
- Record in a quiet room, same time of day for consistent sound

**PHASE 3: Stock Footage**
Download stock footage after voiceover so you know exact durations needed.

### Step 3: File Organization

Create this folder structure:

```
Elite_Seven_Video/
├── 01_Screen_Recordings/
│   ├── 01_hook/
│   │   ├── cluttered_chart.mp4
│   │   └── clean_signalpilot_chart.mp4

```

### Step 4: CapCut Assembly Tutorial

**Opening CapCut:**
1. Create new project (1920x1080, 30fps)
2. Import all folders

**Timeline Structure:**
```
Track 1 (top): Text overlays, graphics, titles
Track 2: Screen recordings / stock footage
Track 3: Voiceover audio
Track 4: Background music (low volume, -12 to -18 dB)
```

**Assembly Process:**

1. **Drag voiceover Session 1 to Track 3**
2. **Listen and add visuals to Track 2:**
   - When script mentions "cluttered charts" → add cluttered_chart.mp4
   - When script mentions "SignalPilot" → add clean_signalpilot_chart.mp4
   - Match timing to spoken words

3. **Add text overlays to Track 1:**
   - Key terms (like "REPAINTING") can appear as text
   - Use CapCut's text presets for consistency

4. **Repeat for each section**

5. **Add transitions:**
   - Use simple cuts or cross-dissolve (0.3-0.5 sec)
   - Don't overdo fancy transitions

6. **Add background music to Track 4:**
   - Volume: -12 to -18 dB (voice should be clear)
   - Fade in at start, fade out at end

7. **Final review:**
   - Watch full video at 1x speed
   - Check audio levels
   - Check timing of visuals to voice

**CapCut Export Settings:**
```
Resolution: 1080p
Frame Rate: 30fps
Quality: High
Format: MP4
```

## We Do Together

| Task | How We Do It |
|------|--------------|
| **Graphics design** | I create the designs (descriptions/layouts), you implement in Canva or I provide exact specifications |
| **Script refinements** | You read it, tell me what feels unnatural, I adjust |
| **Trade walkthrough selection** | You find a real historical trade that matches the criteria, I help verify it's a good example |
| **Review rough cut** | You export a draft, tell me timestamps of issues, I suggest fixes |
| **Thumbnail A/B testing ideas** | I give you 2-3 variations to test |
