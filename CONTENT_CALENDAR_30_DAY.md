## Part 4: Notes & Recommendations

### 4.1 Visual Asset Priorities

**Immediate Creation (Week 1):**
1. ✅ Pentarch 5-phase cycle diagram (carousel-ready)
2. ✅ Repainting explanation graphic (before/after)
3. ✅ Quote cards with brand styling (3-5 templates)
4. ✅ Before/after chart comparison (cluttered vs clean)

**Short-Term (Weeks 2-3):**
1. Volume Oracle demo recording (15-30 sec)
2. Janus Atlas auto-levels demo (15-30 sec)
3. Accumulation vs distribution chart annotation
4. Smart money footprint visual guide

**Ongoing:**
1. Weekly chart screenshot library (real examples)
2. Review/testimonial highlight templates
3. Blog article carousel templates

### 4.2 Sequencing Logic

```
PHASE 1: AUTHORITY (Weeks 1-2)
└── Heavy education, no selling
└── Establish cycle framework understanding
└── Build "they know what they're talking about" trust

PHASE 2: PRODUCT CONTEXT (Weeks 3-4)
└── Introduce indicators as solutions
└── Connect education to tools
└── Address objections preemptively

PHASE 3: CONVERSION (Week 4+)
└── Social proof deployment
└── Free trial emphasis
└── Testimonials and reviews
```

### 4.3 Compliance Checklist

Every post must pass:
- [ ] No directional predictions ("this will go up/down")
- [ ] No financial advice language ("you should buy/sell")
- [ ] Educational framing only ("this is how cycles work")
- [ ] No guaranteed returns or profit claims
- [ ] Disclaimer present where needed

### 4.4 Voice Guidelines

**Do:**
- Direct, professional, confident
- "Here's what the data shows"
- "This is how professionals approach it"
- Question conventional wisdom

**Don't:**
- Hype language ("amazing," "game-changing")
- Urgency tactics ("limited time," "act now")
- AI slop patterns ("In today's fast-paced markets...")
- Emoji overload

### 4.5 Engagement Strategy

**Daily (5-10 min):**
- Reply to all comments within 4 hours
- Like relevant trading content
- Quote-tweet interesting market observations

**Weekly:**
- 1 engagement post asking community questions
- Share 1-2 user wins or testimonials
- Cross-post top performer to Stories

### 4.6 Hashtag Strategy

**Instagram Core (use 5-8):**
```
#tradingview #technicalanalysis #tradingstrategy
#swingtrading #daytrading #priceaction #volumeanalysis
#tradingpsychology #tradereducation #marketcycles
```

**Twitter/X:**
Minimal hashtags. Focus on content quality and threading.
Only use: #TradingView #Trading when relevant

## Part 5: Content Templates

### Thread Template (Twitter/X)

```
[HOOK - Pattern interrupt or contrarian take]

But here's what actually happens:

[Core insight with specific example]

The fix:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

[CTA or follow prompt]
```

### Carousel Template (Instagram)

```
Slide 1: Hook/Question (bold, minimal text)
Slide 2: The Problem (what most traders do wrong)
Slide 3: The Insight (key concept)
Slide 4-5: The Framework (visuals, examples)
Slide 6: The Solution (how this applies)
Slide 7: CTA (save, follow, link in bio)
```

### Quote Card Template
