5. Product demo reel (30 sec - Pentarch in action)
6. Quote card templates (3-5 with brand styling)

**PRE-LAUNCH CONTENT (Dec 23-29):**
1. 5-phase cycle diagram (TD/IGN/WRN/CAP/BDN carousel)

5. Weekly chart screenshot library
6. Review/testimonial highlight templates

### 4.2 Launch Sequencing Logic

```

```

**Twitter/X:**
Minimal hashtags. Focus on content quality and threading.
Only use: #TradingView #Trading when relevant

---

## Part 5: Content Templates

### Thread Template (Twitter/X)

```
[HOOK - Pattern interrupt or contrarian take]

Most traders think [common belief].

But here's what actually happens:

2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

[CTA or follow prompt]
```

### Carousel Template (Instagram)

Slide 2: The Problem (what most traders do wrong)
Slide 3: The Insight (key concept)
Slide 4-5: The Framework (visuals, examples)
Slide 6: The Solution (how this applies)
Slide 7: CTA (save, follow, link in bio)
```

### Quote Card Template

```

### 5.3 Budget Allocation

**If total budget is ~$150:**

| Phase | Post(s) | Spend | Dates |
|-------|---------|-------|-------|

| **Launch** | **Dec 30 post** | **$55** | Dec 30 - Jan 2 |

---

### 5.4 Campaign Objectives by Post

| Post | Objective | Why |
|------|-----------|-----|
| Dec 17 teaser | Profile Visits / Engagement | Build follower base before launch |

| Dec 28 carousel | Reach | Maximum eyeballs before launch |
| **Dec 30 launch** | **Website Clicks / Conversions** | Direct to signalpilot.io |
| Jan 2 carousel | Engagement | Warm audience education |

---

### 5.5 Pro Tips

**Before boosting the launch post (Dec 30):**
- [ ] Let it run organically for 2-3 hours first
- [ ] Wait until it has some likes/comments
- [ ] Then boost — Instagram favors posts with existing traction

**Retargeting (if Meta Ads Manager):**
- Create Custom Audience: "Engaged with profile last 30 days"
- Use this for Dec 30 launch post
- These people saw your teasers — they're warm

**Don't boost:**
- Stories (low ROI for follower growth)
- Posts with no clear CTA
- Anything that looks like an ad already

---

### 5.6 Tracking Checklist

After each boosted post, record:

| Metric | Dec 17 | Dec 24 | Dec 30 | Jan 2 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Spend | $ | $ | $ | $ |
