---

### 6.4 Campaign Objectives by Post

|------|-----------|-----|
| Dec 17 teaser | Profile Visits / Engagement | Build follower base before launch |

---

### 6.5 Pro Tips

**Before boosting the launch post (Dec 30):**
- [ ] Let it run organically for 2-3 hours first
- [ ] Wait until it has some likes/comments
- [ ] Then boost — Instagram favors posts with existing traction

**Retargeting (if Meta Ads Manager):**
- Create Custom Audience: "Engaged with profile last 30 days"
- Use this for Dec 30 launch post
- These people saw your teasers — they're warm

**Don't boost:**
- Stories (low ROI for follower growth)
- Posts with no clear CTA
- Anything that looks like an ad already

---

### 6.6 Tracking Checklist

After each boosted post, record:

| Metric | Dec 17 | Dec 24 | Dec 30 | Jan 2 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Spend | $ | $ | $ | $ |
| Reach | | | | |
| Profile Visits | | | | |
| Follows gained | | | | |
| Link clicks | | | | |

## DEC 23 (MONDAY) — PRE-LAUNCH DAY 1

### X/Twitter — Thread

```
Most traders enter late and exit early.

Not a discipline problem. A visibility problem.

Here's the framework that changed everything for me: ↓

Markets don't move randomly. They cycle through 5 phases:

1. ACCUMULATION (TD)
Smart money quietly builds positions. Price looks "boring." Retail ignores it.

2. MARKUP (IGN)
Demand overwhelms supply. Trend begins. Retail starts noticing.

3. CLIMAX (CAP)
Buying frenzy peaks. Headlines scream. Retail finally goes all-in.

4. DISTRIBUTION (WRN)
Smart money exits into retail buying. Price holds up but momentum dies.

5. DECLINE (BDN)
Supply overwhelms demand. Late entries exit at a loss. Smart money waits for step 1.

The trap?

Retail enters at step 3 (climax) — when it "feels" safest.
Smart money entered at step 1 — when it "felt" scariest.

Once you see the cycle, you can't unsee it.

Something's coming that makes this visible on any chart.

Stay tuned.

## DEC 24 (TUESDAY) — PRE-LAUNCH DAY 2

### X/Twitter — Single Post

```
The repainting problem cost me months of false confidence.

I'd backtest an indicator. Perfect signals. Every reversal, every move.

Then I'd trade it live. Signals would appear... then vanish. Or move to different candles.

The "perfect" backtest was a lie.

The indicator was rewriting history after each new candle.

Most traders never realize this is happening to them.

Here's how to test any indicator in 60 seconds:

1. Screenshot your chart right now
2. Wait 10-20 candles
3. Compare the screenshots

If signals moved, disappeared, or changed — it repaints.

Don't trade indicators that lie to you.

More on this Dec 30.

Every trader must know this.

Slide 2:
PHASE 1: ACCUMULATION (TD)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Smart money builds positions quietly.
Price looks "boring" or "dead."
Common perception: "Nothing's happening here."

Slide 3:
PHASE 2: MARKUP (IGN)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Demand overwhelms supply.
Trend begins.
Common perception: "Maybe I should watch this."

Slide 4:
PHASE 3: CLIMAX (CAP)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Buying frenzy peaks.
Headlines everywhere.
Common perception: "Time to go all in."
← THE TRAP

Slide 5:
PHASE 4: DISTRIBUTION (WRN)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Smart money exits into strength.
Price stalls but doesn't crash yet.
Common perception: "Just a pullback."

Slide 6:
PHASE 5: DECLINE (BDN)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Supply overwhelms demand.
Price falls.
Late entries exit at a loss.

Slide 7:
THE INSIGHT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Late entries happen at climax (feels safe).
Early entries happen at accumulation (feels scary).

## DEC 26 (THURSDAY) — PRE-LAUNCH DAY 4

### X/Twitter — Thread

```
Your 6 indicators aren't confirming each other.

They're wearing different outfits.

Here's the problem nobody talks about: ↓

Most popular indicators are calculated from the same inputs: price and volume.

RSI? Derived from price.
MACD? Derived from price.
Stochastic? Derived from price.
Moving averages? Price.

When they "confirm" each other, it's not independent validation.

It's the same data dressed up differently.

You're not getting 6 opinions. You're getting 1 opinion repeated 6 ways.

This is why traders stack indicators and still lose.

More indicators ≠ more confidence.
Different data sources = actual confirmation.

The fix:
• Use ONE indicator per category
• Make sure they measure different things
• Combine cycle, volume, and structure — not 3 momentum tools

We built something that solves this.

7 indicators. Each measuring something different. Working together.

## DEC 27 (FRIDAY) — PRE-LAUNCH DAY 5

### X/Twitter — Thread

```
How smart money actually moves (and how to see it).

Institutions can't buy or sell in one click like you can. Their size is their constraint.

This creates footprints. Here's what to look for: ↓

The problem for institutions:

If a hedge fund wants to buy $50M of stock, they can't market buy.

One large order would spike the price against them.

So they accumulate slowly. Quietly. Over days or weeks.

This leaves patterns in the data.

ACCUMULATION FOOTPRINTS:
• Higher volume on up moves
• Lower volume on down moves
• Volume spikes at lows without price dropping
• Price holds above key levels despite "bad news"

DISTRIBUTION FOOTPRINTS:
• Higher volume on down moves
• Lower volume on up moves
• Volume spikes at highs without price rising
• Price stalls despite "good news"

The trap that catches retail every time:

Price breaks below support. Stops trigger. Panic selling.

Volume spikes. And then... price reverses.

That wasn't a breakdown. It was a shakeout.

Smart money just bought everyone's panic.

You can see this. You just need the right tools.

We built them.

## DEC 29 (SUNDAY) — PRE-LAUNCH DAY 7

### X/Twitter — Thread

```
The Repainting Problem: How most TradingView indicators lie to you.

That indicator with the perfect backtest? The one that catches every reversal?

It's lying. Here's how: ↓

What is repainting?

An indicator "repaints" when it changes past signals after new data arrives.

Yesterday's "perfect buy signal" at the exact low?

It wasn't there yesterday. The indicator moved it after the fact.

Three types of repainting:

1. SIGNAL RELOCATION
The signal shifts from one candle to another after new candles form.

2. SIGNAL DISAPPEARANCE
A signal appears, you act on it, then it vanishes completely.

3. VALUE RECALCULATION
The indicator's numerical values change retroactively.

Why developers do this:

Some don't know better. They use future data in calculations accidentally.

Others know exactly what they're doing. Perfect backtests sell indicators.

How to test any indicator:

1. Screenshot your chart with the indicator
2. Note exactly where signals appear
3. Wait 10-20 candles
4. Screenshot again
5. Compare

If anything moved, disappeared, or changed — it repaints. Don't trade it.

Our policy:

Every Signal Pilot indicator is audited for repainting.

$100 bounty if you find one that repaints.

Zero takers so far.

Tomorrow, everything goes live.

The problem we spent 2 years solving:

Most traders are drowning in indicators that:
• Repaint (lie about past signals)
• Measure the same thing differently
• Add clutter without adding clarity

The result?
Conflicting signals. Second-guessing. Chasing.

What we built instead:

7 indicators. Each measuring something different.

Cycle position (Pentarch)
Institutional flow (Volume Oracle)
Hidden pressure (Plutus Flow)
Key levels (Janus Atlas)
Multi-market scanning (Augury Grid)
Entry timing (Harmonic Oscillator)
Everything overlay (OmniDeck)

They work together. Or standalone. Your choice.

Every signal confirmed on candle close. Zero repaint. $100 bounty if you prove otherwise.

For 2025:

Stop stacking indicators that say the same thing.
Stop trading signals that disappear.
Stop waiting for someone else to tell you what to see.

Start reading the cycle yourself.

The Elite Seven is live → signalpilot.io

Happy New Year.

## JAN 2 (THURSDAY) — POST-LAUNCH DAY 3

### X/Twitter — Thread (Pentarch Deep Dive)

```
Pentarch: The traffic light for your chart.

It's the flagship indicator in The Elite Seven — and it changes how you see markets.

Here's the complete breakdown: ↓

What Pentarch does:

It maps the 5-phase market cycle in real-time:

TD (Touchdown) → Accumulation / exhaustion
IGN (Ignition) → Markup beginning
WRN (Warning) → Distribution starting
CAP (Climax) → Exhaustion at highs
BDN (Breakdown) → Decline beginning

Each signal tells you WHERE you are in the cycle.

Not "overbought." Not "oversold."

Exactly where you are.

How to read it:

🟢 GREEN ZONE (TD + IGN)
Downtrend exhausting. Accumulation happening.
Smart money building. Upside potential.

🟡 YELLOW ZONE (WRN)
Price still rising. But momentum weakening.
Caution. Distribution may be starting.

🔴 RED ZONE (CAP + BDN)
Uptrend exhausting. Distribution happening.
Smart money exiting. Downside potential.

The components:

• Cycle signals (TD/IGN/WRN/CAP/BDN labels)
• Pilot Line (color-coded trend direction)
• NanoFlow crosses (momentum strength)
• Color-coded candles (market structure)

All confirmed on candle close. Zero repaint.

Why it works:

Most indicators tell you what already happened.

Pentarch tells you where you ARE in the cycle that's still unfolding.

Big difference.

## JAN 3 (FRIDAY) — POST-LAUNCH DAY 4

### X/Twitter — Thread (FAQ)

```
Day 4 since launch.

Here's what traders are asking: ↓

Q: "Does it work on crypto?"

A: Yes. All markets. Stocks, crypto, forex, indices, commodities. The cycle framework is universal.

Q: "What timeframe is best?"

A: All of them. Most popular: 15m-1H for day trading, 4H-Daily for swing trading. Pentarch adapts automatically.

Q: "Do I need TradingView Premium?"

A: No. Free TradingView accounts work. You get 3 indicator slots — enough for Pentarch + 1-2 filters.

Q: "How is this different from TD Sequential?"

A: Pentarch is inspired by TD Sequential but rebuilt from scratch. Cleaner signals, additional confirmation layers, and part of a unified 7-indicator system.

Q: "Does it repaint?"

A: No. Every signal is confirmed on candle close. $100 bounty if you find a repaint. Zero takers.

Q: "Is there a free trial?"

A: Yes. 7 days free. No credit card required.

## JAN 5 (SUNDAY)

### X/Twitter — Thread (Accumulation vs Distribution)

```
Accumulation vs Distribution: Same chart. Opposite outcomes.

Most traders can't tell the difference until it's too late.

Here's how to read them in real-time:

ACCUMULATION (before rally):
- Higher volume on up moves
- Lower volume on pullbacks
- Volume spikes at lows (smart money buying)
- Price holds support despite "bad news"

DISTRIBUTION (before drop):
- Higher volume on down moves
- Lower volume on bounces
- Volume spikes at highs (smart money selling)
- Price stalls despite "good news"

The trap:

SPRING = Price breaks below support, then instantly reverses.
That wasn't a breakdown. Smart money just bought everyone's panic.

UPTHRUST = Price breaks above resistance, then instantly reverses.
That wasn't a breakout. Smart money just sold to FOMO buyers.

Volume Oracle shows you which phase you're in before price confirms.

Stop being the exit liquidity.

Slide 2:
THE PROBLEM:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Price consolidates in a range.
Looks identical on the chart.
But one leads to breakout UP.
The other leads to breakdown DOWN.

Slide 3:
ACCUMULATION (before rally):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Higher volume on up bars
• Lower volume on down bars
• Volume spikes at lows
• Price holds support despite "bad news"
• Smart money is BUYING

Slide 4:
DISTRIBUTION (before drop):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Higher volume on down bars
• Lower volume on up bars
• Volume spikes at highs
• Price stalls despite "good news"
• Smart money is SELLING

Slide 5:
THE WYCKOFF TELLS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SPRING = Price breaks below support, instantly reverses
(Smart money bought the panic)

UPTHRUST = Price breaks above resistance, instantly reverses
(Smart money sold the FOMO)

## JAN 6 (MONDAY)

### X/Twitter — Thread (OmniDeck)

```
OmniDeck: 10 indicators in 1 overlay.

It's the "everything indicator" in The Elite Seven.

Here's what it replaces: ↓

OmniDeck combines:

1. TD Sequential — cycle counting
2. Squeeze Cloud — volatility compression
3. SuperTrend Ensemble — trend direction
4. Bull Market Support Band — macro trend
5. Supply/Demand Zones — key levels
6. Candlestick Patterns — reversal signals
7. Liquidity Sweeps — trap detection
8. Regime System — market state
9. EMA Events — dynamic support/resistance
10. Caution Warnings — risk alerts

All in one clean overlay.

Why this matters:

Most traders stack 6-10 separate indicators.

Different colors. Different scales. Different logic.

Result: Clutter. Confusion. Conflicting signals.

OmniDeck unifies everything.

Same visual language. Same chart. Same logic.

One indicator. Multiple confirmations. Zero clutter.

When to use OmniDeck:

• You want everything in one view
• You're tired of indicator soup
• You need quick multi-factor confirmation
• You trade multiple timeframes

OmniDeck can replace your entire current setup.

Or use it alongside Pentarch for cycle + context.

## JAN 10 (FRIDAY)

### X/Twitter — Thread (Harmonic Oscillator)

```
Harmonic Oscillator: 4 momentum systems voting on your entry.

It's the timing tool in The Elite Seven.

Here's how it works: ↓

The problem with single oscillators:

RSI says oversold. MACD says bearish. Stochastic says neutral.

Which one do you trust?

Usually, the one that confirms your bias. (This is how you lose money.)

Harmonic Oscillator's solution:

It combines 4 momentum systems into one voting mechanism:

When they agree: 4/4 (high confidence)
When they split: 2/4 (low confidence)

Simple visual. No interpretation needed.

What you see:

- Live vote count: "3 Bulls, 1 Neutral"
- Confidence rating: 1/4 to 4/4
- Composite line: All 4 oscillators unified

How to use it:

4/4 = All 4 agree. High confidence entry.
3/4 = Strong agreement. Good entry.
2/4 = Mixed signals. Wait or reduce size.
1/4 = Disagreement. Stay out.

The edge:

You're not guessing which oscillator to trust.

You're seeing consensus.

4 opinions > 1 opinion.

## JAN 13 (MONDAY)

### X/Twitter — Thread ($100 Bounty)

```
$100 bounty: Find a repaint, keep the money.

We've been live for 2 weeks.

Zero takers. Here's why: ↓

What repainting is:

An indicator "repaints" when it changes past signals after new candles form.

That "perfect" backtest? It was rewritten after the fact.

How we prevent it:

Every Signal Pilot indicator:
• Confirms signals on candle CLOSE
• Uses no future data in calculations
• Is manually audited for lookahead bias

Our guarantee:

If you can prove any Elite Seven indicator repaints, you get $100 USD.

Screenshot before. Screenshot after. Show the difference.

We'll pay.

Why we're confident:

Because we built these for ourselves first.

We trade with them. We can't afford them to lie.

2 weeks live. Thousands of signals. Zero repaints found.

The bounty stands.

## JAN 17 (FRIDAY)

### X/Twitter — Thread (Smart Money)

```
The distribution trap: Buying when institutions are selling.

Here's the tell most traders miss: ↓

The setup:

Stock rallies 40% in 3 weeks.

Headlines: "Breakout! New highs!"

Common reaction: "Finally time to buy."

What's actually happening:

While price rises on lower volume...

Institutional selling is absorbing retail buying.

Every retail buy = an institution exiting.

This is distribution.

The tells:

• Price rising, volume falling
• Big volume spikes on red days (selling)
• Price can't hold above resistance
• "Good news" doesn't push price higher

What happens next:

Institutions finish selling.

No more buying pressure to absorb.

Price falls. Late entries get trapped. The cycle resets.

The cycle repeats.

How to avoid it:

Track the flow. Not the price.

Volume Oracle shows accumulation/distribution phases in real-time.

Don't be the exit liquidity.

## JAN 18 (SATURDAY)

### X/Twitter — Thread (2-Week Recap)

```
2 weeks since launch.

Here's what we've learned from early Signal Pilot users:

1. Most start with just Pentarch.
One indicator. One framework. They master the cycle signals before adding anything else.

2. Volume Oracle creates "aha moments."
Seeing accumulation/distribution in real-time changes how people read charts forever.

3. The education hub gets used more than expected.
82 free lessons. People are working through them alongside the indicators.

4. Most common feedback:
"I wish I found this earlier."

5. The $100 repaint bounty still stands.
Zero takers. Zero repaints found. 2 weeks of signals verified.

Thank you to everyone who joined early.

If you're still on the fence: 7-day free trial. No credit card.

## JAN 20 (MONDAY)

### X/Twitter — Thread (Kelly Criterion)

```
Kelly Criterion: The math behind position sizing that pros use.

Most traders size positions by "feel."

Here's the framework that actually works: ↓

What is Kelly Criterion?

A formula that tells you exactly how much to risk based on your edge.

Too much = unnecessary risk, potential ruin
Too little = leaving money on the table

Kelly finds the sweet spot.

The formula:

Kelly % = W - [(1-W) / R]

W = Win rate (% of trades that win)
R = Win/Loss ratio (avg win ÷ avg loss)

Example:

Win rate: 55%
Avg win: $200
Avg loss: $100
R = 2.0

Kelly % = 0.55 - [(1-0.55) / 2.0]
Kelly % = 0.55 - 0.225
Kelly % = 0.325 = 32.5%

Meaning: Risk 32.5% of bankroll on each trade.

The catch:

Full Kelly is aggressive. Most pros use "Half Kelly" or "Quarter Kelly" for smoother equity curves.

Half Kelly = 16.25% in this example
Quarter Kelly = 8.125%

Why this matters:

Without a sizing framework, you're guessing.

Guessing leads to:
• Over-betting after wins (overconfidence)
• Under-betting after losses (fear)
• Inconsistent results

Kelly removes emotion from sizing.

MULTI-TIMEFRAME CONFIRMATION

Slide 2:
THE MISTAKE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
You see a perfect setup on the daily.

You enter.

Price immediately reverses.

Why? Weekly trend was against you.

Slide 3:
THE FRAMEWORK:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WEEKLY = Trend direction
DAILY = Setup identification
4H/1H = Entry timing

Higher timeframe trumps lower timeframe.

Slide 4:
THE RULE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Only trade daily setups that ALIGN with weekly direction.

Long setups? Weekly must be bullish.
Short setups? Weekly must be bearish.

Slide 5:
WITH PENTARCH:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Weekly showing IGN (bullish cycle)?
→ Look for TD signals on daily for entries

Weekly showing CAP (bearish cycle)?
→ Look for WRN signals on daily for exits

Slide 6:
Alignment = higher probability.
Fighting the trend = expensive lessons.

---

## 8.1 Comment Reply Templates

### Positive Comments

**When someone says "This looks great" / "Interesting":**
```
Thanks — let us know if you have any questions about getting started.
```

**When someone says "Just signed up":**
```
Welcome. Start with Pentarch — it's the foundation. Docs are at docs.signalpilot.io if you need setup help.
```

**When someone shares a win:**
```
Good read. What timeframe were you on?
```

### Questions

**"Does this work on [asset/market]?":**
```
Yes — works on stocks, crypto, forex, indices. Any market on TradingView.
```

**"What timeframe is best?":**
```
All timeframes work. Most popular: 15m-1H for day trading, 4H-Daily for swing trading. Pentarch adapts automatically.
```

**"Is there a free trial?":**
```
Yes — 7 days free, no credit card required. signalpilot.io
```

**"Does it repaint?":**
```
No. Every signal confirms on candle close. $100 bounty if you find a repaint — zero takers so far.
```

**"How is this different from [other indicator]?":**
```
Can't speak to other tools. Ours: verified non-repainting, unified 7-indicator system, 82 free lessons included. Best way to compare is the 7-day trial.
```

### Skeptical/Neutral

**"Looks like every other indicator":**
```
Understandable skepticism. The difference is in the verification — $100 bounty for finding a repaint, 82 free lessons regardless of purchase, and a unified system instead of disconnected tools. Trial is free if you want to test it.
```

**"I'll stick with my current setup":**
```
Fair enough. The 82 free lessons at education.signalpilot.io might still be useful — no purchase required.
```

---

## 8.2 DM Response Templates

**General inquiry:**
```
Thanks for reaching out. Happy to help — what questions do you have?
```

**Pricing question:**
```
Full pricing is at signalpilot.io. There's a 7-day free trial with no credit card required so you can test everything first.
```

**Technical support:**
```
For setup help, check docs.signalpilot.io first — most common questions are answered there. If you're still stuck, let me know the specific issue and I'll help.
```

**Partnership/collab request:**
```
Thanks for the interest. Best way to discuss is email — you can reach us through the contact form at signalpilot.io.
```

---

## 8.3 Negative Response Protocol

### Criticism Handling

**"This is a scam" / "Another garbage indicator":**
```
Understand the skepticism — the indicator space has a lot of problems. Our approach: $100 bounty if you find a repaint (zero takers), 82 free lessons without purchase, 7-day trial without credit card. We're not asking you to trust — we're asking you to test.
```

**"Your indicators don't work":**
```
Sorry to hear that. What specifically isn't working? Happy to help troubleshoot if you share more details.
```

**"I lost money using this":**
```
No indicator predicts markets. Ours show cycle position and flow — entries and risk management are still your responsibility. The 82 free lessons at education.signalpilot.io cover position sizing and risk if that would help.
```

### Repaint Accusations

**"I found a repaint":**
```
If you can document it (before/after screenshots, same chart, same timeframe), send it to us. $100 bounty is real. We've had zero verified claims in [X] weeks of live trading.
```

### Trolls/Bad Faith

**Obvious trolling:**
Do not engage. Hide comment if platform allows. Do not delete unless it violates platform rules.

**Repeated harassment:**
Block after one warning. Document for records.

# Part 9: TESTIMONIAL COLLECTION STRATEGY

---

## 9.1 When to Ask

**Best times to request testimonials:**
- 7 days after sign-up (initial impressions)
- After a user shares a positive comment or DM
- After a user completes the education hub
- At 30-day mark (experienced users)

---

## 9.2 How to Ask

**DM Template (after positive interaction):**
```
Glad it's clicking for you. Would you mind if we shared your feedback? A quick quote about your experience would help others understand what to expect. Totally optional — and you can stay anonymous if you prefer.
```

**Follow-up if they agree:**
```
Appreciate it. A 1-2 sentence quote works perfectly. Something like what you told me, or whatever feels natural. Would you like to be credited as @username or stay anonymous?
```

---

## 9.3 Testimonial Format

**What to collect:**
- Quote (1-3 sentences)
- Attribution preference (username, first name only, or anonymous)
- Permission confirmation (screenshot the DM for records)
- Optional: their trading focus (day trading, swing, crypto, etc.)

**Storage:**
Keep a running document of testimonials with:
- Date received
- Quote text
- Attribution
- Permission confirmation
- Used in (which post/platform)
