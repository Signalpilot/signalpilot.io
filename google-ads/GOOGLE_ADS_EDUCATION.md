## Testing Plan

### Phase 1: Test (Weeks 1-2)
- Budget: $3/day
- Bidding: Maximize Clicks
- Goal: Get traffic data, check bounce rates

### Phase 2: Evaluate (Week 3)
- Check: Do education visitors go to main site?
- Check: Cost per visitor vs direct ads
- Decision: Scale or kill

### Phase 3: Scale (If successful)
- Increase budget to $10-15/day
- Add more ad groups (by topic: cycles, volume, structure)
- Consider remarketing to education visitors

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| CTR | >3% (free content should get high CTR) |
| CPC | <$0.50 (educational keywords are cheaper) |
| Bounce Rate | <60% |
| Education → Main Site | >10% of visitors |
| Cost per Main Site Visit | <$5 |

---

## Notes

- Education site is English only (no localized versions)
- Sitelink 4 bridges to main product - this is the conversion path
- If this works, consider dedicated remarketing campaign for education visitors
- Monitor Search Terms report for irrelevant queries (add negatives)

---

## Negative Keywords (Recommended)
```
-job
-jobs
-hiring
-salary
-degree
-university
-college
-certification
-certified
-cfa
-series 7
-license
```
