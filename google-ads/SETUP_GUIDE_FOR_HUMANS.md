# PART 8: LAUNCH & MONITOR

## Step 8.1: Review Everything

Before enabling, double-check:

- [ ] Each ad group has at least 1 ad
- [ ] Extensions are added
- [ ] Negative keywords are added
- [ ] Bid adjustments are set
- [ ] Conversion tracking is installed

## Step 8.2: Enable the Campaign

1. Go to your campaign
2. Toggle the status from "Paused" to **"Enabled"**
3. Your ads will start running!

## Step 8.3: Daily Monitoring (First 2 Weeks)

Check these every day:

| Metric | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| Impressions | Are ads showing? Should see 100+ per day |
| Clicks | Are people clicking? |
| CTR | Should be 2-5%. Below 1% = problem |
| Avg CPC | Is it within your budget? |
| Conversions | Are people signing up for trials? |

# TROUBLESHOOTING

## "My ads aren't showing"

1. Check if campaign is **Enabled** (not Paused)
2. Check if you have budget remaining
3. Check if ads are approved (go to Ads → check Status column)
4. Search for your keywords on Google - ads may not show every time

## "My ads were disapproved"

1. Read the disapproval reason carefully
2. Common issues:
   - "Financial services" - Add disclaimer, focus on "educational tools"
   - "Misleading claims" - Remove profit promises
   - "Destination not working" - Check your URL works
3. Edit the ad to fix the issue, then request review

## "I'm getting clicks but no conversions"

1. Check conversion tracking is working (test it yourself)
2. Check landing page loads properly
3. Check trial form is working
4. Your targeting might be too broad - try more specific keywords

## "CPC is too high"

1. Lower your max CPC bid limit
2. Try phrase match instead of broad match keywords
3. Add more negative keywords
4. Target less competitive countries (remove US, focus on UK/AU)
